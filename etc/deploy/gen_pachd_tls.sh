Error: You must set either --dns or --ip

Usage:
Generate a self-signed TLS certificate for Pachyderm

Args:
  --dns  Set the domain name in the certificate (i.e. the common name with
         which pachd will authenticate)

  --ip   The IP address in the certificate (which you plan to use to connect
         to pachd. Without this, enabling TLS while connecting to pachd over
         an IP will not work)

   -o <prefix>
        This script generates a public TLS cert at <prefix>.pem and <prefix>.key
        Setting this arg determines the output file names.
