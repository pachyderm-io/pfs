# script which executes as `root`. Without `chown`ing `~/cached-deps` (where
# we store cacheable binaries), any calls to those binaries would fail because
# they're otherwised owned by `root`.
#
# To further complicate things, we update the `PATH` to include
# `~/cached-deps` in `.travis.yml`, but this doesn't update the PATH for
# calls using `sudo`. If you need to make a `sudo` call to a binary in

#
#     sudo env "PATH=$PATH" minikube foo
#
mkdir -p ~/.cache/go-build
sudo chown -R `whoami` ~/.cache/go-build
