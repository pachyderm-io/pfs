// TransactionContext is a helper type to encapsulate the state for a given
// set of operations being performed in the Pachyderm API.  When a new
// transaction is started, a context will be created for it containing these
// objects, which will be threaded through to every API call:
//   ctx: the client context which initiated the operations being performed
//   pachClient: the APIClient associated with the client context ctx
//   stm: the object that controls transactionality with etcd.  This is to ensure
//     that all reads and writes are consistent until changes are committed.
//   txnEnv: a struct containing references to each API server, it can be used
//     to make calls to other API servers (e.g. checking auth permissions)
//   pfsDefer: an interface for ensuring certain PFS cleanup tasks are performed
//     properly (and deduped) at the end of the transaction.
