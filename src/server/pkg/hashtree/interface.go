	// OK is returned on success

	// Unknown is returned by Code() when an error wasn't emitted by the HashTree
	// implementation.
	Unknown

	// Internal is returned when a HashTree encounters a bug (usually due to the
	// violation of an internal invariant).
	Internal

	// CannotSerialize is returned when Serialize(io.Writer) fails, normally
	// due to it being called on an OpenHashTree
	CannotSerialize

	// CannotDeserialize is returned when Deserialize(bytes) fails, perhaps due to
	// 'bytes' being corrupted. Or it being called on an OpenHashTree.
	CannotDeserialize

	// Unsupported is returned when Deserialize(bytes) encounters an unsupported
	// (likely old) serialized HashTree.
	Unsupported

	// PathNotFound is returned when Get() or DeleteFile() is called with a path
	// that doesn't lead to a node.
	PathNotFound

	// MalformedGlob is returned when Glob() is called with an invalid glob
	// pattern.
	MalformedGlob

	// PathConflict is returned when a path that is expected to point to a
	// directory in fact points to a file, or the reverse. For example:
	// 1. PutFile is called with a path that points to a directory.
	// 2. PutFile is called with a path that contains a prefix that
	//    points to a file.
	// 3. Merge is forced to merge a directory into a file
	PathConflict

	// ObjectNotFound is returned when GetObject() is called with an object
	// that doesn't exist.
	ObjectNotFound

	// HeaderFooterConflict is returned when PutFileHeaderFooter is called on a
	// path of the form parent/child, but the DirectoryNode at 'parent' doesn't
	// have a header or footer (headers and footers cannot be added to directories
	// retroactively, as that would require modifying all of the directory's
	// children to indicate that they include header data in their parent)
	HeaderFooterConflict

	// MixedObjectsAndBlockRefs is returned when PutFile attempts to append
	// Objects to a file that already has BlockRefs or BlockRefs to a file that
	// already has Objects. This generally happens when you user tries to copy
	// from an output file to an input file that already has content, or tries

	// file.

	// PutDirHeaderFooter creates a directory at 'path' with the given header

	// one is already set (if a directory was created without header/footer
	// metadata, PutDirHeaderFooter cannot convert it to a header/footer
	// directory, and will simply return an error.
	//
	// If a directory is a header/footer directory, files that it directly
	// contains will inherit the header/footer that the directory stores without
	// incurring any extra storage themselves. Also, this header metadata will be
	// exposed to PFS, allowing for nice semantics there (for example,
	// pfs.GetFile with a glob argument will only append the header data once to
	// the concatenated contents of all matching files, so that uploading
	// header-containing data with PutFileSplit and then downloading it with
	// GetFile+glob yields the original data. Also, pfs.InspectFile will make
	// sure file hashes reflect the header content, even if it changes after the
	// file is initially created and the file's non-header content stays
	// unchanged, etc)
	//
	// Note: If 'header' or 'footer' is empty, then header data will no longer be
	// appended to children of 'file's parent directory, but because
	// HasHeaderFooter will still be set on all of those children, Pachyderm will
