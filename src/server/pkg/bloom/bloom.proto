  // to produce a new filter which should be identical to running all operations
  // from the original two filters onto a blank filter.
  // Negative bucket values may be useful if we were to add a background
  // reprocessing stage that would iterate over all existing items and re-add
  // them, but would also track live updates to the set.  Due to live updates,
  // some buckets may need to go negative temporarily - but we would lose the
  // guarantee that removing something that wasn't added to the set is an error.
  // Perhaps better to provide a 'BloomFilterDelta' that can later be combined
  // into an existing filter, while still preserving the invariant that all
  // buckets are positive.
