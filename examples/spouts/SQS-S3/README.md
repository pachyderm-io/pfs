# Amazon SQS S3 Spout

This example describes how to create a simple spout
that listens for "object added" notifications on an
Amazonâ„¢ Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue, grabs the
files, and places them in its output repo.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following configured in your environment to
run this example:

* An AWS account
* Pachyderm 1.9.5 or later

## Configure AWS Prerequisites

Before you can run this spout, you need to configure
an S3 bucket, a Simple Notification Service (SNS),
and an SQS queue in your AWS account.

Complete the following steps:

1. Create an S3 Bucket.
2. Create an SNS topic and an SQS queue as described in
the [Amazon Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ways-to-add-notification-config-to-bucket.html).
3. In your S3 bucket, add an event notification:

   1. Select your S3 bucket.
   2. Go to **Properties**.
   3. Click **Events > Add notification**.
   4. Select **All object create events**.
   5. In **Send to**, select **SQS Queue** and pick your
   SQS queue from the dropdown list.

4. Test that the SNS topic and SQS are working by adding a test
   file into your S3 bucket. You should get an email notification
   about a new object created in the bucket.

## Create a Spout

Use [the SQS example pipeline specification](sqs-spout.json)
and [the sample Python script](sqs-spout.py)
to create a spout pipeline:

1. Clone the Pachyderm repository:

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:pachyderm/pachyderm.git
   ```

1. Add the following environment variables to `sqs-spout.json`:

   * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   * `AWS_REGION`
   * `OUTPUT_PIPE`
   * `S3_BUCKET`
   * `SQS_QUEUE_URL`
   * `VERBOSE_LOGGING`

   For more information, see [Pipeline Environment Parameters](#pipeline-environment-parameters).

1. Create a pipeline from `sqs-spout.json`:

   ```bash
   $ pachctl create pipeline -f /path/to/sqs-spout.json
   ```

1. Verify that the pipeline was created:

   ```bash
   $ pachctl list pipeline
   NAME       VERSION INPUT    CREATED        STATE / LAST JOB
   sqs-spout  1       none     2 minutes ago  running / starting
   ```

   You should also see that an output repository was created for your
   spout pipeline:

   ```bash
   $ pachctl list repo
   NAME       CREATED       SIZE
   sqs-spout  2 minutes ago 0B
   ```

## Run the Spout

After you create an SQS spout, you can test it by uploading a file
into your S3 bucket and later finding it in the
SQS pipeline output repository.

To test the spout, complete the following steps:

1. In the IAM console, go to S3 and find your bucket.
1. Upload a file into your bucket. For example, `01-pipeline.png`. Depending
on the size of the file, it might take some time for the file to get uploaded.
1. In your terminal, run:

   ```bash
   $ pachctl list commit sqs-spout
   REPO      BRANCH COMMIT                           PARENT    STARTED        DURATION           SIZE
   sqs-spout master 4ecc933d523d485b8a9cce6b1feeac95 none      6 minutes ago  Less than a second 37.44KiB
   ```

1. Verify that the file that you have uploaded to the S3 bucket is
in the `sqs-spout` output repository. Example:

   ```bash
   $ pachctl list file sqs-spout@master
   NAME             TYPE SIZE
   /01-pipeline.png file 37.44KiB
   ```
