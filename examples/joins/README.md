# Inner and Outer Join Pipelines 
>![pach_logo](./img/pach_logo.svg) The outer join functionality is available in version **1.12 and higher**.
- Our first example will walk you through a typical inner join case. In a similar way to SQL, "inner-join" pipelines **only** run your code on the files, in your joined repositories, that match a specific naming pattern  (i.e., ***match your glob pattern/capture groups***). In Pachyderm's terms, inner joins will only create a datum (see Key concepts below) if there is a match in all join repos.
- Our second example will showcase 3 variations of "outer-join" pipelines and outline how they differ from the first. In short, outer joins specify that for an input repo with `"outer_join": true` set in the pipeline specifications, datums will still be created even if it does not have a match.


>![pach_logo](./img/pach_logo.svg) Remember, in Pachyderm, the join operates at the file-path level, **not** the content of the files themselves. Therefore, the structure of your directories and file naming conventions are key elements when implementing your use cases in Pachyderm.

## 1. Getting ready
***Key concepts***
- [Join](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/concepts/pipeline-concepts/datum/join/) pipelines - execute your code on files that match a specific naming pattern in your join repo.
- [glob patterns](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/concepts/pipeline-concepts/datum/glob-pattern/) - for "RegEx-like" string matching on file paths and names.

You might also want to brush up your [datum](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/concepts/pipeline-concepts/datum/relationship-between-datums/) knowledge. 

***Prerequisite***
- A workspace on [Pachyderm Hub](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/pachhub/pachhub_getting_started/) (recommended) or Pachyderm running [locally](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/getting_started/local_installation/).
- [pachctl command-line ](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/getting_started/local_installation/#install-pachctl) installed, and your context created (i.e., you are logged in)

***Getting started***
- Clone this repo.
- Make sure Pachyderm is running. You should be able to connect to your Pachyderm cluster via the `pachctl` CLI. 
Run a quick:
```shell
$ pachctl version

COMPONENT           VERSION
pachctl             1.12.0
pachd               1.12.0
```
Ideally, have your pachctl and pachd versions match. At a minimum, you should always use the same major & minor versions of your pachctl and pachd. 
## 2. Data structure and naming convention
We have derived our examples from simplified retail use cases: 
- Purchases and Returns are made in given Stores. 
- Those Stores have a given location (here, a zip code). 
- There are 0 to many Stores in a given Zipcode.

Let's have a look at our data structure and naming convention. 
* Repo: `stores` - In these examples, store data are JSON files named after the store's identifier.
```shell
    └── STOREID1.txt
    └── STOREID2.txt
    └── STOREID3.txt
    └──  ...
```
The goal of this example is to build a list of all purchases by `zipcode.` This is what the content of one of those STOREIDx.txt files looks like.
```shell
    {
        "storeid":"4",
        "name":"mariposa st.",
        "address":{
            "zipcode":"94107",
            "country":"US"
        }
    }
```

>![pach_logo](./img/pach_logo.svg) Had we not needed the location info(zip) in the content of the Store file, and, say, just wanted to aggregate purchases by STOREID, then a [group](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/concepts/pipeline-concepts/datum/group/) could have been used instead.  

* Repo: `purchases` - Each purchase info is kept in a file named by concatenating the purchase's order number and its store ID.
```shell
    └── ORDERW080520_STOREID1.txt
    └── ORDERW080521_STOREID1.txt
    └── ORDERW078929_STOREID2.txt
    └── ...
```
* Repo: `returns` - Same naming convention as purchases.
```shell
    └── ORDERW080528_STOREID5.txt
    └── ODERW080520_STOREID1.txt
    └── ...
```
## 3. Data preparation
Let's first create our mock dataset and create/populate our repositories.
This preparatory step will allow you to experiment with the inner and outer join examples in any order.

***Step 1*** - Prepare your data
The setup target of the `Makefile` in `pachyderm/examples/joins` will create 3 directories (stores, purchases, and returns) with our example data.
In the `examples/joins` directory, run:
```shell
$ make setup
```
***Step 2*** - Create and populate Pachyderm's repositories.
In the `examples/joins` directory, run:
```shell
$ make create
```
or run:
```shell
$ pachctl create repo stores
$ pachctl create repo purchases
$ pachctl create repo returns
$ pachctl put file -r stores@master:/ -f stores
$ pachctl put file -r purchases@master:/ -f purchases
$ pachctl put file -r returns@master:/ -f returns
```

Have a quick look at your repositories: 
```shell
$ pachctl list file stores@master
$ pachctl list file purchases@master
$ pachctl list file returns@master
```
You should see the following files:
- Stores:

![stores_repository](./img/pachctl_list_file_stores_master.png)

- Purchases:

![purchases_repository](./img/pachctl_list_file_purchases_master.png)

- Returns:

![returns_repository](./img/pachctl_list_file_returns_master.png)

## 4. Example 1 - An Inner-Join pipeline creation 
***Goal***
List all purchases by zip code. 
>![pach_logo](./img/pach_logo.svg) Remember that we will only see the zip code of the stores where purchases actually happened. That is what inner joins do.

1. **Pipeline input repositories**: `stores` and `purchases` - Inner join by STOREID.
2. **Pipeline**: Executes a python code reading the `zipcode` in the matching STOREIDx.txt file and appending the matched purchase file's content to a text file named after the zip code. (see pipeline [inner_join.json](./inner_join.json))
3. **Pipeline output repository**: `inner_join`- list of text files named after the stores' zip codes in which purchases have been made and containing the list of said purchases. 

In the diagram below, we have mapped out the data of our example. We will expect the 2 following files in the output repository of our `inner_join` pipeline: 
```shell
    └── 02108.txt
    └── 90210.txt
```
Each should contain 3 purchases.

![inner_join](./img/inner_join.png)

***Step 3*** - Now let's create your pipeline. 

Because unprocessed data are awaiting in your entry repositories, the pipeline creation will automatically trigger a job.
In the `examples/joins` directory, run:
```shell
$ pachctl create pipeline -f inner_join.json
```

Now a quick check at your pipeline's status:
```shell
$ pachctl list pipeline
```
Once it has run successfully, you should see something like this:

![output_repository](./img/pachctl_list_pipeline.png)

>![pach_logo](./img/pach_logo.svg) You will notice two pipelines (inner_join and inner_join_build). We only created one.  This comes from the use of a [Python builder](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/how-tos/developer-workflow/build-pipelines/#python-builder). The builder builds your own container (including your python file `./src/inner/main.py`) on top of a Docker *base image*. It is instrumental in development mode as it allows you to modify your code without having to build, tag, and push your image to your registry each time.

See the `transform.build.language` field in our pipeline's (inner_join.json) specifications :
```shell
    "transform": {
        "build": { 
        "language":"python",
        "path": "./src/inner"
        }
    }
```
A more classic way, once 'production-ready,' would be to reference your [built Docker image](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/how-tos/developer-workflow/working-with-pipelines/#step-2-build-your-docker-image) as in the example below:
```shell
    "transform": {
        "cmd": [ "python3", "/edges.py" ],
        "image": "pachyderm/opencv"
    }
```

***Step 4*** - Let's have a look at our final product: Check the output repository of your pipeline.
```shell
$ pachctl list file inner_join@master
```
You should see our 2 expected text files. 

![output_repository](./img/pachctl_list_file_inner_join_master.png)

Now for a visual confirmation of their content:
```shell
$ pachctl get file inner_join@master:/02108.txt
```
>![pach_logo](./img/pach_logo.svg) Want to take this example to the next level? Practice using joins AND [groups](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/concepts/pipeline-concepts/datum/group/). You can create a 2 steps pipeline that will group Returns and Purchases by storeID then join the output repo with Stores to aggregate by location. 

## 5. Example 2 - Outer-Join pipeline creation 
>![pach_logo](./img/pach_logo.svg) You specify an outer join by adding an "outer_join" boolean field to an input repo in your pipeline spec (see outer_join.json [here](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/blob/example-join/examples/joins/outer_join.json)). This boolean can be set independently on one or many input repo. Setting `"outer_join": true` means that files in that repo, even if they don't match, will still be processed as a datum. 

***Goal***
For each location, list **all stores** (with or without return) belonging to a given zipcode and display their returns, if any. When going through your location files, you should notice that **all returns** in your `Returns` repo have been listed.

1. **Pipeline input repositories**: `stores` and `returns` - Outer join by STOREID on both repositories.
2. **Pipeline**: Executes a python code reading the `zipcode` (if any...) in the matching STOREIDx.txt file and appending the matched return file's content (if any...) to a text file named after the zip code. (see pipeline [outer_join.json](./outer_join.json))
3. **Pipeline output repository**: `outer_join`- list of text files named after the stores' zip codes. 

>![pach_logo](./img/pach_logo.svg) In our example, `"outer_join": true` is set on both repositories: Returns and Stores. Although the behaviour of an outer-join in Pachyderm differs from SQL, think about this example as a *full outer* between Returns and Stores. Unlike the inner-join above, each location file (zipcode.txt) will list **all** stores (with or without returns) in that location. Additionnaly, we have created an edge case here, with one return made in a store (Store 0) that does not belong to our Stores' list and therefore has an unknown zipcode. You will notice that this return will show in an additionnal UNKNOWN.txt file. This is the direct result of the `"outer_join": true` set on the returns repo. We are seeing **all** returns, with or without listed Store.

In the diagram below, we have mapped out the data of our example and the expected match. 
![full_outer_join](./img/full_outer_join.png)

***Step 5*** - Let's create your new pipeline.
In the `examples/joins` directory, run:
```shell
$ pachctl create pipeline -f outer_join.json
```
Then check your pipeline's status:
```shell
$ pachctl list pipeline
```
Once it has fully and successfully run, have a look at your output repository to confirm that it looks like what we expect.
```shell
$ pachctl list file outer_join@master
```
Now for a visual confirmation of the content of one specific file:
```shell
$ pachctl get file outer_join@master:/02108.txt
```
The following table lists the expected result for this scenario:

![full_outer_join_digest](./img/full_outer_join_digest.png)

>![pach_logo](./img/pach_logo.svg) Want to take this example to the next level? Try experimenting with having your outer join set only on one repo at a time. We have drawn diagrams to help you visualize what is happening in each of those two scenarios. 

- Case 1: Outer set on Stores only

In this case, you will consider all **zip of stores listed** in our repo, **with or without returns**

![outer_join_on_stores](./img/outer_join_on_stores.png)

Your end result should look like this.

![outer_join_on_stores_digest](./img/outer_join_on_stores_digest.png)

- Case 2: Outer set on Returns only

In this case, you will consider the zip of **all stores** (listed in our repo or not) **where at least one return was made**.

![outer_join_on_stores](./img/outer_join_on_returns.png)

Your end result should look like this.
