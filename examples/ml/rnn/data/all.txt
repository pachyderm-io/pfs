 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I wish I could be here when you wake up <eos> I 'm going north with Uncle Benjen <eos> I 'm taking the black <eos> I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together , but you 'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you 're better <eos> I 'll know my way around by then <eos> I 'll be a sworn brother of the Night 's Watch <eos> We can go out walking beyond the Wall , if you 're not afraid <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> I want you to leave <eos>
 <open-exp> Eddard walks into the room , Jon kisses Brandon on the forehead and exits <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon <eos> You came back a year later with another woman 's son <eos> And now you 're leaving again <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I have no choice <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> That 's what men always say when honor calls <eos> That 's what you tell your families , tell yourselves <eos> You do have a choice <eos> And you 've made it <eos> I can 't do it , Ned <eos> I really can 't <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You can <eos> You must <eos>

 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> My mother <question>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> She was very kind <eos>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> Good <eos> Next time I see you , you 'll be all in black <eos>

 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Gods , this is country <exclamation> I 've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I 've half a mind to go with you <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> What do you say , just you and me on the Kingsroad , swords at our sides , a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You should have asked me 20 years ago <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> There were wars to fight , women to marry <eos> <eos> <eos> We never had the chance to be young <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I recall a few chances <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> There was that one <eos> <eos> <eos> Oh , what was her name <question> That common girl of yours <question> Becca <question> With the great big tits you could bury your face in <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Bessie <eos> She was one of yours <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Bessie <exclamation> Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits <eos> Yours was <eos> <eos> <eos> Aleena <question> No <eos> You told me once <eos> Meryl <question> Your bastard 's mother <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Wylla <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> That 's it <eos> She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor <eos> You never told me what she looked like <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Nor will I <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> We were at war <eos> None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again <eos> You 're too hard on yourself <eos> You always have been <eos> I swear if I weren 't your King , you 'd have hit me already <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> The worst thing about your coronation <eos> <eos> <eos> I 'll never get to hit you again <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Trust me , that 's not the worst thing <eos> There was a rider in the night <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord <eos> What of it <question> Should we send her a wedding gift <question>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> A knife perhaps , a good sharp one , and a bold man to wield it <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> She 's little more than a child <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Tell me we 're not speaking of this <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Oh , it 's unspeakable to you <question> What her father did to your family <eos> <eos> <eos> That was unspeakable <eos> What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister <eos> <eos> <eos> the woman I loved <eos> I 'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> But you can 't get your hands on this one , can you <question>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> This Khal Drogo , it 's said he has 100 , 000 men in his horde <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm , as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea <eos> They have no ships , Robert <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper <eos> If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back , the scum will join him <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> He will not cross <eos> And if by chance he does , we 'll throw him back into the sea <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> There 's a war coming , Ned <eos> I don 't know when , I don 't know who we 'll be fighting , but it 's coming <eos>

 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Rapers <eos> They were given a choice no doubt <eos> <eos> <eos> Castration or the Wall <eos> Most choose the knife <eos> Not impressed by your new brothers <question> Lovely thing about the Watch <eos> <eos> <eos> You discard your old family and get a whole new one <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Why do you read so much <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Look at me and tell me what you see <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Is this a trick <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> What you see is a dwarf <eos> If I 'd been born a peasant they might 've left me out in the woods to die <eos> Alas , I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock <eos> Things are expected of me <eos> My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Until your brother killed that King <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Yes , until my brother killed him <eos> Life is full of these little ironies <eos> My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him <eos> I must do my part for the honor of my house , wouldn 't you agree <question> But how <question> Well , my brother has his sword and I have my mind <eos> And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone <eos> That 's why I read so much <eos> And you <question> What 's your story , bastard <question>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Ask me nicely and maybe I 'll tell you , dwarf <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> A bastard boy with nothing to inherit , off to join the ancient order of the Night 's Watch , alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> The Night 's Watch protects the realm from <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Yes yes , against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about <eos> You 're a smart boy <eos> You don 't believe that nonsense <eos> <eos> <eos> Everything 's better with some wine in the belly <eos>

 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Everywhere <question> Even in the east <question>
 <boname> IRRI <eoname> No dragon <eos> Brave men kill them <eos> It is known <eos>
 <boname> JHIQUI <eoname> It is known <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> The moon <question>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> He told me the moon was an egg , Khaleesi , that once there were two moons in the sky <eos> But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat <eos> Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun 's fire <eos>
 <boname> IRRI <eoname> Moon is no egg <eos> Moon is goddess <eos> <eos> <eos> wife of sun <eos> It is known <eos>
 <boname> JHIQUI <eoname> It is known <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Leave me with her <eos> Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories <question>
 <open-exp> Irri leaves the tent <eos> <close-exp>

 <open-exp> Catelyn holds council in the Godswood with Robb , Theon Greyjoy , Rodrick and Maester Luwin <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> What I am about to tell you must remain between us <eos> I don 't think Bran fell from that tower <eos> I think he was thrown <eos>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> The boy was always sure-footed before <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> Someone tried to kill him twice <eos> Why <question> Why murder an innocent child <question> Unless he saw something he wasn 't meant to see <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Saw what , my lady <question>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> I don 't know <eos> But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved <eos> We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown <eos>
 <boname> RODRICK_CASSEL <eoname> Did you notice the dagger the killer used <question> It 's too fine a weapon for such a man <eos> The blade is Valyrian steel , the handle dragonbone <eos> Someone gave it to him <eos>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> They come into our home and try to murder my brother <question> If it 's war they want <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> If it comes to that , you know I 'll stand behind you <eos>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> What , is there going to be a battle in the Godswood <question> Too easily words of war become acts of war <eos> We don 't know the truth yet <eos> Lord Stark must be told of this <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> I don 't trust a raven to carry these words <eos>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> I 'll ride to King 's Landing <eos>

 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> Mother , you can 't <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> I must <eos>
 <boname> RODRICK_CASSEL <eoname> I 'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> Too large a party attracts unwanted attention <eos> I don 't want the Lannisters to know I 'm coming <eos>
 <boname> RODRICK_CASSEL <eoname> Let me accompany you at least <eos> The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone <eos>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> What about Bran <question>

 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia <eos> Magisters sold their palaces <eos> Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours <eos> They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Well , she sounds like an interesting woman <eos> I don 't think that Drogo will like it with me on top <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> You will make him like it , Khaleesi <eos> Men want what they 've never had <eos> And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch <eos> Are you a slave , Khaleesi <question> Then don 't make love like a slave <eos> Very good , Khaleesi <eos> Out there he is the mighty Khal , but in this tent , he belongs to you <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> I don 't think that this is the Dothraki way <eos>

 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> Is this some trick <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> The wolf is of the north <eos> She deserves better than a butcher <eos>

 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> Thank the gods you 're here , Stark <eos> About time we had some stern northern leadership <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Glad to see you 're protecting the throne <eos>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> Sturdy old thing <eos> How many kings ' asses have polished it , I wonder <question> What 's the line <question> The King shits and the Hand wipes <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Very handsome armor <eos> Not a scratch on it <eos>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> I know <eos> People have been swinging at me for years , but they always seem to miss <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You 've chosen your opponents wisely then <eos>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> I have a knack for it <eos> It must be strange for you coming into this room <eos> I was standing right here when it happened <eos> He was very brave , your brother <eos> Your father too <eos> They didn 't deserve to die like that <eos> Nobody deserves to die like that <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> But you just stood there and watched <eos>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> 500 men just stood there and watched <eos> All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms <eos> You think anyone said a word , lifted a finger <question> No , Lord Stark <eos> 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt <eos> Except for the screams , of course , and the Mad King laughing <eos> And later <eos> <eos> <eos> When I watched the Mad King die , I remembered him laughing as your father burned <eos> <eos> <eos> It felt like justice <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Is that what you tell yourself at night <question> You 're a servant of justice <question> That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen 's back <question>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> Tell me <eos> <eos> <eos> If I 'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back , would you admire me more <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You served him well , when serving was safe <eos>

 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Lord Stark <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Lord Varys <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad <eos> We are all praying for Prince Joffrey 's full recovery <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> A shame you didn 't say a prayer for the butcher 's son <eos> Renly <exclamation> You 're looking well <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> And you look tired from the road <eos> I told them this meeting could wait another day , but <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> But we have a Kingdom to look after <eos> I 've hoped to meet you for some time , Lord Stark <eos> No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> She has , Lord Baelish <eos> I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> All too well <eos> I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> It wasn 't the man that I chose , my Lord <eos> It was Catelyn Tully <eos> A woman worth fighting for , I 'm sure you 'll agree <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> I humbly beg your pardon , my Lord Stark <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Grand Maester <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> How many years has it been <question> You were a young man <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> And you served another King <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> How forgetful of me <eos> This belongs to you , now <eos> Should we begin <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Without the King <question>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Winter may be coming , but I 'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> His Grace has many cares <eos> He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> We are the lords of small matters here <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark 's appointment as Hand of the King <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Mmm , how much <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> 40 , 000 gold dragons to the champion , 20 , 000 to the runner-up , 20 , 000 to the winning archer <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Can the treasury bear such expense <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> I 'll have to borrow it <eos> The Lannisters will accommodate , I expect <eos> We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold <eos> What 's another 80 , 000 <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> I 'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> How could you let this happen <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> The Master of Coin finds the money <eos> The King and the Hand spend it <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice , but I fear His Grace doesn 't always listen <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> "Counting coppers , " he calls it <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I 'll speak to him tomorrow <eos> This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> As you will <eos> But still , we 'd best make our plans <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> There will be no plans until I speak to Robert <eos> Forgive me , my Lords <eos> I had a long ride <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> You are the King 's Hand , Lord Stark , we serve at your pleasure <eos>

 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> Please , it 's nearly healed <eos>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> It 's ugly <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> A King should have scars , you fought off a direwolf <eos> You 're a warrior like your father <eos>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> I 'm not like him <eos> I didn 't fight off anything <eos> It bit me and all I did was scream <eos> And the two Stark girls saw it , both of them <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> That 's not true <eos> You killed the beast <eos> You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father <eos> When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne , your father was a rebel and a traitor <eos> Someday you 'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it <eos>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> Do I have to marry her <question>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> Yes <eos> She 's very beautiful and young <eos> If you don 't like her , you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes , to make little princes and princesses <eos> And if you 'd rather fuck painted whores , you 'll fuck painted whores <eos> And if you 'd rather lie with noble virgins , so be it <eos> You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be <eos> Do something nice for the Stark girl <eos>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> I don 't want to <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> No , but you will <eos> The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road <eos>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> We allow the northerners too much power <eos> They consider themselves our equals <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> How would you handle them <question>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> I 'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10 , 000 men to the royal army <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> A royal army <question>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> Why should every lord command his own men <question> It 's primitive , no better than the hill tribes <eos> We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown , trained by experienced soldiers <eos> <eos> <eos> Instead of a mob of peasants who 've never held pikes in their lives <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> And if the northerners rebel <question>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> I 'd crush them <eos> Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North <eos> Uncle Kevan , maybe <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> And these 10 , 000 northern troops , would they fight for you or their lord <question>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> For me <eos> I 'm their King <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> But you 've just invaded their homeland , asked them to kill their brothers <eos>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> I 'm not asking <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> The North cannot be held <eos> <eos> <eos> not by an outsider <eos> It 's too big and too wild <eos> When the winter comes , the Seven gods together couldn 't save you and your royal army <eos> A good King knows when to save his strength <eos> <eos> <eos> And when to destroy his enemies <eos>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> So you agree <eos> <eos> <eos> The Starks are enemies <question>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> Everyone who isn 't us is an enemy <eos>

 <boname> GRENN <eoname> We 'll talk later , Lord Snow <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me <eos> No one but you <eos> My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Grenn 's father left him too <eos> <eos> <eos> Outside a farmhouse when he was three <eos> Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese <eos> His little sister hadn 't eaten in three days <eos> He was given a choice his right hand or the Wall <eos> I 've been asking the Lord Commander about them <eos> Fascinating stories <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> They hate me because I 'm better than they are <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> It 's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik <eos> I don 't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here <eos> Your brother Bran <eos> He 's woken up <eos>

 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> Lance through the heart <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Quick one <eos> Lucky for you <eos> Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall <eos> My horse took an arrow so I was on foot , slogging through the mud <eos> He came running at me , this dumb high-born lad , thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword <eos> I knocked him down with the hammer <eos> Gods , I was strong then <eos> Caved in his breastplate <eos> Probably shattered every rib he had <eos> Stood over him , hammer in the air <eos> Right before I brought it down he shouted , "Wait <exclamation> Wait <exclamation>" <eos> <eos> <eos> They never tell you how they all shit themselves <eos> They don 't put that part in the songs <eos> Stupid boy <eos> Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else <eos> He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable , his sons would be ingrates , and he 'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl <eos> Wine <exclamation> Lancel <eos> Gods , what a stupid name <eos> Lancel Lannister <eos> Who named you <question> Some halfwit with a stutter <question> What are you doing <question>

 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood <eos>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> I was there that day <eos> You were only a squire , 16 years old <eos>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte <eos> Best move I ever saw <eos>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> A good fighter , Toyne , but he lacked stamina <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Your outlaw <eos> <eos> <eos> Any last words <question>

 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> From whom <question>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching , you have two choices pay tribute or fight <eos> An easy choice for most <eos> Of course , sometimes it 's not enough <eos> Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he 's given <eos> He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly <eos> Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven 't had a good fight in months and need the practice <eos>

 <boname> BENJEN_STARK <eoname> I hope we 've provided you with some good stories to tell when you 're back in King 's Landing <eos> But something to think about while you 're drinking your wine down there , enjoying your brothels <eos> <eos> <eos> Half the boys you 've seen training will die north of the Wall <eos> Might be a wilding 's axe that gets them , might be sickness , might just be the cold <eos> They die in pain <eos> And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort <eos>

 <boname> BENJEN_STARK <eoname> You know , my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word "but" really counts <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> But <eos> <eos> <eos> I don 't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall <eos> I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up , our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it <eos>
 <boname> BENJEN_STARK <eoname> You 're right <eos> The wildlings are no different from us <eos> A little rougher maybe <eos> But they 're made of meat and bone <eos> I know how to track them and I know how to kill them <eos> It 's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights <eos> You 've never been north of the Wall , so don 't tell me what 's out there <eos>
 <boname> YOREN <eoname> Are you going below <question> Keep well , keep warm <eos>
 <boname> BENJEN_STARK <eoname> Enjoy the capital , brother <eos>

 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong <eos> Just so <eos> One hand is all that is needed <eos> Now you are standing all wrong <eos> Turn your body side-face <eos> So <eos> You are skinny <eos> That is good <eos> The target is smaller <eos> Now the grip <eos> <eos> <eos> Let me see <eos> The grip must be delicate <eos>
 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> What if I drop it <question>
 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> The steel must be part of your arm <eos> Can you drop part of your arm <question> No <eos> Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos <eos> He knows these things <eos> You must listen to me , boy <eos>
 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> I 'm a girl <eos>
 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> Boy , girl <eos> <eos> <eos> You are a sword , that is all <eos> That is the grip <eos> You are not holding a battle-axe <eos> You are holding <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> A needle <eos>
 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> Ahhh<ellipsis> Just so <eos> Now we will begin the dance <eos> Remember , child , this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning <eos> <eos> <eos> The knight 's dance , hacking and hammering <eos> This is the Bravo 's dance <eos> <eos> <eos> The water dance <eos> It is swift and sudden <eos> All men are made of water , do you know this <question> If you pierce them , the water leaks out and they die <eos> Now you will try to strike me <eos>
 <open-exp> Arya takes several attempts as Syrio turns his back , defending her and disarming her constantly <eos> She begins picking up on a few things , but still needs much work <eos> Ned enters in the doorway and his smile turns to a grimace watching his daughter swordfight <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> Up <exclamation> Dead <eos> Dead <eos> Very dead <eos> Come <eos> Again , faster <eos>
<eoepisode> <open-exp> Open to Bran Stark dreaming <eos> He is in the courtyard of Winterfell shooting a bow as a raven flies in <eos> As he approaches it , it flies into the crypt , continuously cawing <eos> As Bran enters the crypt he makes direct eye contact with the raven and sees that it has three eyes <eos> He wakes up <eos> Theon enters just as he wakes up <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> OLD_NAN <eoname> The little Lord 's been dreaming again <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> We have visitors <eos>
 <boname> BRAN_STARK <eoname> I don 't want to see anyone <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Really <question> If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company , I 'd go mad <eos> Anyway , you don 't have a choice <eos> Robb 's waiting <eos>
 <boname> BRAN_STARK <eoname> I don 't want to go <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Neither do I <eos> But Robb 's Lord of Winterfell , which means I do what he says and you do what I say <eos> Hodor <exclamation> (Hodor enters , hoisting up Bran and carrying him away) Help Bran down the hall <eos>
 <open-exp> Tyrion standing in front of Robb and Maester Luwin inside the Winterfell castle <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit <eos>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> Any man of the Night 's Watch is welcome at Winterfell <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Any man of the Night 's Watch , but not I , eh , boy <question>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> I 'm not your boy , Lannister <eos> I 'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Then you might learn a lord 's courtesy <eos>
 <open-exp> Hodor enters carrying Bran <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> So it 's true <eos> Hello Bran <eos> Do you remember anything about what happened <question>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> He has no memory of that day <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Curious <eos>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> Why are you here <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel <question> My neck is beginning to hurt <eos>
 <boname> BRAN_STARK <eoname> Kneel , Hodor <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Do you like to ride , Bran <question>
 <boname> BRAN_STARK <eoname> Yes <eos> Well , I mean I did like to <eos>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> The boy has lost the use of his legs <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> What of it <question> With the right horse and saddle , even a cripple can ride <eos>
 <boname> BRAN_STARK <eoname> I 'm not a cripple <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Then I 'm not a dwarf <eos> My father will rejoice to hear it <eos> I have a gift for you <eos> Give that to your saddler <eos> He 'll provide the rest <eos> You must shape the horse to the rider <eos> Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy 's voice <eos>
 <boname> BRAN_STARK <eoname> Will I really be able to ride <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> You will <eos> On horseback you will be as tall as any of them <eos>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> Is this some kind of trick <question> Why do you want to help him <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples , bastards and broken things <eos>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> You 've done my brother a kindness <eos> The hospitality of Winterfell is yours <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Spare me your false courtesies , Lord Stark <eos> There 's a brothel outside your walls <eos> There I 'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier <eos>
 <open-exp> Before Tyrion exits Winterfell for the brothel , Theon sees him off in the courtyard <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Couldn 't resist some northern ass <question> If you like redheads , ask for Ros <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Come to see me off , Greyjoy <question> Kind of you <eos> Your master doesn 't seem to like Lannisters <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> He 's not my master <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> No , of course not <eos> What happened here <question> Where is lady Stark <question> Why didn 't she receive me <question>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> She wasn 't feeling well <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> She 's not in Winterfell , is she <question> Where did she go <question>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> My lady 's whereabouts <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> My lady <question> Your loyalty to your captors is touching <eos> Tell me , how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey <question> I still remember seeing my father 's fleet burn in Lannisport <eos> I believe your uncles were responsible <question>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Must have been a pretty sight <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive <eos> Yes , a great victory for your people <eos> Shame how it all turned out <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> We were outnumbered 10 to one <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> A stupid rebellion then <eos> I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle <eos> Now here you are , your enemy 's squire <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Careful , Imp <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> I 've offended you <eos> Forgive me , it 's been a rough morning <eos> Anyway , don 't despair <eos> I 'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I 've learned to live with it <eos> Your next tumble with Ros is on me <eos> I 'll try not to wear her out <eos>

 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> These are my people now <eos> You shouldn 't call them savages <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> I 'll call them what I like , because they 're my people <eos> This is my army <eos> Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> If my brother was given an army of Dothraki , could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms <question>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea <eos> They fear any water their horses can 't drink <eos>

 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> They call you the last dragon <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> They do <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> You have dragon 's blood in your veins <question>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> It 's entirely possible <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> What happened to the dragons <question> I was told that brave men killed them all <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> The brave men didn 't kill dragons <eos> The brave men rode them <eos> Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen <eos> The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne , which the Usurper is keeping warm for me <eos> The swords of the vanquished , a thousand of them <eos> <eos> <eos> melted together like so many candles <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> I have always wanted to see a dragon <eos> There is nothing in the world that I would rather see <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Really <question> Why dragons <question>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> They can fly <eos> And wherever they are , just a few flaps of their wings and they 're somewhere else <eos> <eos> <eos> Far away <eos> And they can kill <eos> Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing <eos> <eos> <eos> melted <eos> <eos> <eos> like so many candles <eos> Seeing a dragon would make me very happy <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Well , after 15 years in a pleasure house , I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> I was not locked in <eos> I have seen things <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> What have you seen <question>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> I 've seen <eos> <eos> <eos> A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass <eos> I 've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes <eos> And I 've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk <eos> So <eos> <eos> <eos> Have you seen one <question>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> A pirate ship <question>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> A dragon <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> No , the last one died many years before I was born <eos> I 'll tell you what I have seen their skulls <eos> They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep <eos> When I was very young , just 3 or 4 , my father used to walk me down the rows and I 'd recite their names for him <eos> When I got them all right , he 'd give me a sweet <eos> The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong <eos> Skulls no bigger than dog skulls <eos> But as you got closer to the Iron Throne <eos> <eos> <eos> They got bigger and bigger and bigger <eos> There was Ghiscar and Valryon , Vermithrax , Essovius , Archonel , Meraxes , Vhagar <eos> <eos> <eos> And Balerion the Dread <eos> <eos> <eos> whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> What happened to the skulls <question>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> I don 't know <eos> The Usurper had them smashed to powder , I expect <eos> Scattered to the wind <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> That 's very sad <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Yes , it is <eos> What did I buy you for <question> To make me sad <question>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> No , your Grace <eos> To teach your sister <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> To teach my sister how to be a better lover <question> You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy <question> You pretty little idiot <eos> Go on then <eos> Get on with it <eos>

 <boname> SEPTA_MORDANE <eoname> I wouldn 't worry about that <eos>

 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> And everyone would hate me <eos>
 <boname> SEPTA_MORDANE <eoname> Nobody could ever hate you <eos>
 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> Joffrey does <eos>

 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> The King 's tournament <eos> I assure you the Hand wants no part of it <eos>
 <boname> JANOS_SLYNT <eoname> Call it what you will , Lord Stark Ser , the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day <eos> Last night we had a tavern riot , a brothel fire , three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Dreadful <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> If you can 't keep the King 's peace , perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can <eos>
 <boname> JANOS_SLYNT <eoname> I need more men <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You 'll get 50 <eos> Lord Baelish will see it paid for <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> I will <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You found money for a champion 's purse , you can find money to keep the peace <eos> I 'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left <eos>
 <boname> JANOS_SLYNT <eoname> Thank you , my Lord Hand Ser <eos> They will be put to good use <eos>

 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> This heat <eos> On days like this , I envy you northerners your summer snows <eos> Until tomorrow my Lord <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I 've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Lord Arryn <question> His death was a great sadness to all of us <eos> I took personal charge of his care , but I could not save him <eos> His sickness struck him very hard and very fast <eos> I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed <eos> Lord Jon often came to me for counsel <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Why <question>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> I have been Grand Maester for many years <eos> Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> What did Jon want the night before he died <question>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> He came inquiring after a book <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> A book <question> What book <question>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> I fear it would be of little interest to you , my Lord <eos> A ponderous tome <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I 'd like to read it <eos>
 <open-exp> Now in Pycelle 's room , he hands a book to Ned <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> "The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms , with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children <eos>"
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> "Harkon Umber , first of his name , born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon 's landing , at the last hearth <eos> Blue of eye , brown of hair and fair complected , died in his 14th year of a wound sustained
 <open-exp> in a bear hunt <eos>" <close-exp>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> As I said , my Lord , a ponderous read <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it <question>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> He did not , my Lord <eos> And I did not presume to ask <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Jon 's death <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Such a tragedy <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Did he say anything to you during his final hours <question>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Nothing of import , my Lord <eos> There was one phrase he kept repeating "The seed is strong , " I think it was <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> "The seed is strong" <question> What does that mean <question>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> The dying mind is a demented mind , Lord Stark <eos> For all the weight they 're given , last words are usually as significant as first words <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> And you 're quite certain he died of a natural illness <question>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> What else could it be <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Poison <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> A disturbing thought <eos> I don 't think it likely <eos> The Hand was loved by all <eos> What sort of man would dare <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I 've heard it said that poison is a woman 's weapon <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Yes <eos> Women , cravens <eos> <eos> <eos> and eunuchs <eos> Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Everybody knows that <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Yes , yes , of course <eos> How that sort of person found himself on the King 's Council , I will never know <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I 've taken enough of your time <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> No trouble at all , my Lord <eos> It 's a great honor <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Thank you <eos> I 'll find my own way out <eos>

 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> Now that Bran 's awake will he come live with us <question>

 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> He wants to be a knight of the King 's Guard <eos> He can 't be one now , can he <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> No <eos> But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King 's Council <eos> Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder <eos>
 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> Can I be Lord of a holdfast <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle <eos> And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords <eos>

 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Yes <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> The wiser answer was no , my Lord <eos> Get a message to this paragon of yours <eos> <eos> <eos> Discreetly <eos> Send him to question Ser Hugh <eos> After that , you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city <eos> He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Why <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> I have my observers , as I said , and it 's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Lord Baelish , perhaps I was wrong to distrust you <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Distrusting me was the wisest thing you 've done since you climbed off your horse <eos>

 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I didn 't think you 'd be so upset about it <eos>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> Why not <question> Because I 'm fat <question> But I like girls just as much as you do <eos> They might not like me as much <eos> I 've never <eos> <eos> <eos> been with one <eos> You 've probably had hundreds <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> As a matter of fact , I 'm the same as you <eos>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> I find that hard to believe <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I came very close once <eos> I was alone in a room with a naked girl , but <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> You didn 't know where to put it <question>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I know where to put it <eos>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> Was she <eos> <eos> <eos> Old and ugly <question>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Young and gorgeous <eos> A whore named Ros <eos>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> What color hair <question>

 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> What 's my name <question>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> Jon Snow <question>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> And why is my surname Snow <question>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> Because <eos> <eos> <eos> You 're a bastard from the north <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I never met my mother <eos> My father wouldn 't even tell me her name <eos> I don 't know if she 's living or dead <eos> I don 't know if she 's a noblewoman or a fisherman 's wife <eos> <eos> <eos> Or a whore <eos> So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes <eos> But I couldn 't do it <eos> Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child , another bastard named Snow <question> It 's not a good life for a child <eos>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> So <eos> <eos> <eos> You didn 't know where to put it <question>

 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I build my own fires <eos>
 <boname> ALLISER_THORNE <eoname> That 's admirable <eos> I spent six months out there , beyond the Wall during the last winter <eos> It was supposed to be a two-week mission <eos> We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch <eos> So we went out to look for some of his men <eos> <eos> <eos> Capture them , gather some knowledge <eos> The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men <eos> Harder than you 'll ever be <eos> They know their country better than we do <eos> They knew there was a storm coming in <eos> So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass <eos> And we got caught in the open <eos> Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground , roots and all <eos> If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss , you lost a finger to the frost <eos> And all in darkness <eos> You don 't know cold <eos> Neither of you do <eos> The horses died first <eos> We didn 't have enough to feed them , to keep them warm <eos> Eating the horses was easy <eos> But later when we started to fall <eos> <eos> <eos> That wasn 't easy <eos> We should have had a couple of boys like you along , shouldn 't we <question> Soft , fat boys like you <eos> We 'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup <eos> Soon we 'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night 's Watch , but you 'd be fools to believe it <eos> You 're boys still <eos> And come the winter you will die <eos> <eos> <eos> Like flies <eos>

 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Not what you were expecting <question> Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound <question> Lovely little tale of brotherly love <eos> The Hound was just a pup , six years old maybe <eos> Gregor a few years older , already a big lad , already getting a bit of a reputation <eos> Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence <eos> One evening <eos> <eos> <eos> Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire <eos> <eos> <eos> Gregor 's toy , a wooden knight <eos> Gregor never said a word , he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals <eos> Held him there while the boy screamed , while his face melted <eos> There aren 't very many people who know that story <eos>
 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> I won 't tell anyone <eos> I promise <eos>

 <boname> KNIGHT_OF_HOUSE_WHENT <eoname> She is <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun <eos> My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen <eos>
 <boname> KNIGHT_OF_HOUSE_BRACKEN <eoname> Our lord is honored by his trust <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> I envy your father all his fine friends , but I don 't quite see the purpose of this <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> Knight of House Frey Lord Walder is well , my Lady <eos> He has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th nameday <eos> He plans to take another wife <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> This man <eos> <eos> <eos> Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son , a boy of 10 <eos> In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve , I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king 's justice <eos>

 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital <question>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> No <eos> I stood vigil for him myself last night <eos> He had no one else <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> He 'd never worn this armor before <eos>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> Bad luck for him <eos> <eos> <eos> Going against the Mountain <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Who determines the draw <question>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> All the knights draw straws , Lord Stark <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Aye <eos> <eos> <eos> But who holds the straws <question> You 've done good work , Sisters <eos>
 <open-exp> Ned and Barristan both exit the tent and begin walking <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> Life is strange <eos> Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I 'm glad we never met on the field , Ser Barristan <eos> <eos> <eos> as is my wife <eos> I don 't think the widow 's life would suit her <eos>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> You 're too modest <eos> I 've seen you cut down a dozen great knights <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> My father once told me you were the best he 'd ever seen <eos> I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat <eos>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> He was a fine man , your father <eos> What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> And that lad <eos> <eos> <eos> He was a squire until a few months ago <eos> How could he afford a new suit of armor <question>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money <question> I hear the King wants to joust today <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Yes <eos> That will never happen <eos>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> Robert tends to do what he wants <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> If the King got what he wanted all the time , we 'd still be fighting a damned rebellion <eos>
 <open-exp> Ned separates from Barristan and enters King Robert 's tent <eos> Lancel , Robert 's squire , is attempting to dress him in his armor <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Maybe you should have one invented <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> All right , all right <eos> But you watch me out there <eos> I still know how to point a lance <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You have no business jousting <eos> Leave that for the young men <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Why <question> Because I 'm king <question> Piss on that <eos> I want to hit somebody <exclamation>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> And who 's going to hit you back <question>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Anybody who can <eos> And the last man in his saddle <eos> <eos> <eos> will be you <exclamation>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> There 's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you <eos>

 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Loras knew his mare was in heat <eos> Quite crafty , really <eos>
 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> Ser Loras would never do that <exclamation> There 's no honor in tricks <eos>

 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> Remove his hood <eos>
 <boname> MARILLION <eoname> On that eve , the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp , no more would he preen and primp , in garb of red and gold <eos> (singing)
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> This isn 't the Kingsroad <eos> You said we were riding for Winterfell <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> I did <eos> <eos> <eos> often and loudly <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Very wise <eos> They 'll be out in droves , looking for me in the wrong place <eos> Word 's probably gotten to my father by now <eos> He 'll be offering a handsome reward <eos> Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts <eos> Would you be so good as to untie me <question>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> And why would I do that <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Why not <question> Am I going to run <question> The hill tribes would kill me for my boots <eos> Unless a Shadowcat ate me first <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Ah <eos> <eos> <eos> the Eastern Road <eos> We 're going to The Vale <eos> You 're taking me to your sister 's to answer for my imagined crimes <eos> Tell me , Lady Stark <eos> When was the last time you saw your sister <question>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> Five years ago <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> She 's changed <eos> She was always a bit touched , but now <eos> <eos> <eos> you might as well kill me here <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> I am not a murderer , Lannister <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Neither am I <exclamation> I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son 's life <exclamation>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> The dagger found
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade <question>
 <boname> RODRIK_CASSEL <eoname> Should I gag him <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Why <question> Am I starting to make sense <question>
 <boname> RODRIK_CASSEL <eoname> My Lady , this way <eos>

 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Untie me <eos> If I die , what 's the point <question>
 <open-exp> Tyrion , now loose , runs over and picks up a shield <eos> He fends off an attack as another of Lady Stark 's men kills him <eos> Another tribesman is nearing Catelyn , Tyrion rushes over with his shield , knocks him to the ground and begins slamming it into his throat , directly in front of , and in defense of Catelyn <eos> The battle comes to an end with many of their men defeated <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> VARYS <eoname> "Delay , " you say <eos> "Move fast , " I reply <eos> This is no longer a game for two players <eos>
 <boname> ILLYRIO_MOPATIS <eoname> It never was <eos>

 <open-exp> Varys enters the Throne Room , where Baelish is standing , looking at the throne <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> The first to arrive and the last to leave <eos> I admire your industry <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> You do move quietly <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> We all have our qualities <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> You look a bit lonely today <eos> You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening <eos> First boy is on the house <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> I think you 're mistaking business with pleasure <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Am I <question> All those birds that whisper in your ear , such pretty little things <eos> Trust me , we accommodate all inclinations <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Oh , I 'm sure <eos> Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young , I hear <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> I 'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion , both equally important <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality , no <question> Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> All desires are valid to a man with a full purse <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers <eos> Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination <eos> The logistics alone <eos> <eos> <eos> to find beautiful corpses before they rot <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Strictly speaking , such a thing would not be in accordance with the King 's laws <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Strictly speaking <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Tell me <eos> Does someone , somewhere , keep your balls in a little box <question> I 've often wondered <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Do you know , I have no idea where they are <question> And we had been so close <eos> But enough about me <eos> How have you been since we last saw each other <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Since you last saw me or since I last saw you <question>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Now the last time I saw you , you were talking to the Hand of the King <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Saw me with your own eyes <question>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Eyes I own <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Council business <eos> We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Everyone 's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark 's wife <eos> If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy 's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion <eos> <eos> <eos> To think <eos> <eos> <eos> A simple word to the Queen <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> One shudders at the thought <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Oh <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> But you know something <question> I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Have you <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Yes <eos> Earlier today , I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Was that you under the bed <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary <eos> <eos> <eos> Council business <question> Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea <eos> You 're from there yourself , after all <eos> We 're friends , aren 't we , Lord Varys <question> I 'd like to think we are <eos> So you can imagine my burden , wondering if the King might question my friend 's sympathies<ellipsis> To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend , turning right , loyalty to the realm <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Oh , please <eos>

 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> There was no time to send word <eos>
 <boname> VARDIS_EGEN <eoname> May I ask , my Lady , why he is with you <question>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> That 's why there was no time <eos> He is my prisoner <eos>

 <boname> STEWARD <eoname> Lord Stark , your presence has been requested in the small council chamber <eos> A meeting has been called <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I need to see the King first -- alone <eos>
 <boname> STEWARD <eoname> The King is at the small council meeting , my Lord <eos> He has summoned you <eos>

 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> The whore is pregnant <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You 're speaking of murdering a child <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> I warned you this would happen <eos> Back in the North , I warned you , but you didn 't care to hear <eos> Well , hear it now <eos> I want 'em dead , mother and child both <eos> And that fool , Viserys as well <eos> Is that plain enough for you <question> I want them both dead <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Honor <question> <exclamation> I 've got Seven Kingdoms to rule <exclamation> One King , Seven Kingdoms <eos> Do you think honor keeps them in line <question> Do you think it 's honor that 's keeping the peace <question> It 's fear <exclamation> Fear and blood <exclamation>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Then we 're no better than the Mad King <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Careful , Ned <eos> Careful now <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You want to assassinate a girl <eos> <eos> <eos> Because the Spider heard a rumor <question>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> No rumor , my Lord <eos> The princess is with child <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Based on whose information <question>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Ser Jorah Mormont <eos> He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Mormont <question> You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Jorah Mormont 's a slaver , not a traitor <eos> Small difference , I know , to an honorable man <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> He broke the law , betrayed his family , fled our land <eos> We commit murder on the word of this man <question>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> And if he 's right <question> If she has a son <question> A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army<ellipsis> What then <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> The Narrow Sea still lies between us <eos> I 'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Do nothing <question> That 's your wise advice <question> Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores <question> You 're my council <question> Counsel <exclamation> Speak sense to this honorable fool <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> I understand your misgivings , my Lord <eos> Truly , I do <eos> It is a terrible thing we must consider , a vile thing <eos> Yet , we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm <eos> Should the gods grant Daenerys a son , the realm will bleed <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> I bear this girl no ill will , but should the Dothraki invade , how many innocents will die <question> How many towns will burn <question> Is it not wiser , kinder even , that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live <question>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> We should have had them both killed years ago <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman , best close your eyes , get it over with <eos> Cut her throat <eos> Be done with it <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I followed you into war - twice , without doubts , without second thoughts <eos> But I will not follow you now <eos> The Robert I grew up with didn 't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> She dies <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I will have no part in it <eos>

 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> You 're jealous <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Are you sure this won 't hurt <question>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> Only if I slip <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> And you prefer me like this <question>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> Mhmm <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> If you want hairless , maybe you should find a little boy <eos>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> I want you <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> My brother thinks that anyone who hasn 't been to war isn 't a man <eos> He treats me as if I 'm a spoiled child <eos> Oh , and you 're not <question> Loras Tyrell , the Knight of the Flowers <question> How many wars have you fought in <question> Oh , and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours <question>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> Hold still <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I 'm not tough enough , how I squirm at the sight of blood <eos>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> You did vomit when that boy 's eye was knocked out in the mêlée <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> His eye was dangling out of the damn socket <exclamation>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> He shouldn 't have entered the mêlée if he didn 't know how to fight <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Easy for you to say <eos> Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman <eos>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> It 's not a gift <eos> No one gave it to me <eos> I 'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> I could work at fighting all day , every day , and still never be as good as you <eos>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> Yes well , I guess we 'll never know <eos>
 <open-exp> Finished with Renly 's chest , Loras raises his arm so he can shave his armpit <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> Everywhere <eos> So how did it end up <question> The Targaryen girl will die <question>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> It needs to be done , unpleasant as it is <eos> Robert 's rather tasteless about it <eos> Every time he talks about killing her , I swear the table rises six inches <eos>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> It 's a shame he can 't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> He does have a deep , abiding lust for her money <eos> You have to give it to the Lannisters , they may be the most pompous , ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world , but they do have outrageous amounts of money <eos>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> I have an outrageous amount of money <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Not as much as the Lannisters <eos>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> But a lot more than you <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Robert 's threatening to take me hunting with him <eos> Last time we were out there for two weeks , tramping through the trees in the rain , day after day <eos> All so he can stick his spear into something 's flesh <exclamation> Oh <eos> but Robert loves his killing <eos> And he 's the King <eos>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> Hmm <eos> <eos> <eos> How did that ever happen <question>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it <eos>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> Do you know who should be King <question>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Be serious <eos>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> I am <eos> My father could be your bank <eos> I 've never fought in a war before , but I 'd fight for you <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> I 'm fourth in line <eos>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> And where was Robert in the line of royal succession <question> Joffrey is a monster <eos> Tommen is eight <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Stannis <question>

 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> What are you doing <question> <exclamation>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> Look at it <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> You cut me <exclamation>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> It 's just blood <eos> We 've all got it in us <eos> Sometimes a little spills <eos> If you become King , you 're going to see a lot of this <eos> You need to get used to it <eos> Go on <eos> Look <eos> People love you <eos> They love to serve you because you 're kind to them <eos> They want to be near you <eos>
 <boname> LORAS_TYRELL <eoname> You 're willing to do what needs to be done , but you don 't gloat over it <eos> You don 't love killing <eos> Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst <question> That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared <eos> You would be a wonderful King <eos>

 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> No <eos> He 's not serious enough <eos> I 'll say this for Ned Stark - he 's serious enough <eos> Was it really worth it <question> Losing him this way <question>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> I don 't know <eos> But I do know this , if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea <eos> <eos> <eos> We won 't be able to stop them <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> The Dothraki don 't sail <eos> Every child knows that <eos> They don 't have discipline <eos> They don 't have armor <eos> They don 't have siege weapons <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> It 's a neat little trick you do , you move your lips and your father 's voice comes out <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> Is my father wrong <question>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Let 's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back <eos> We hole up in our castles , a wise move <eos> Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field <eos> They leave us in our castles <eos> They go from town to town , looting and burning , killing every man who can 't hide behind a stone wall , stealing all our crops and livestock , enslaving all our women and children <eos> How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King , their cowardly King hiding behind high walls <question> When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> We still outnumber them <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Which is the bigger number -- five or one <question>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> Five <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Five <eos> <eos> <eos> one <eos> One army , a real army , united behind one leader with one purpose <eos> Our purpose died with the Mad King <eos> Now we 've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse <eos> And everybody wants something different <eos> Your father wants to own the world <eos> Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> What do you want <question>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> We haven 't had a real fight in nine years <eos> Back-stabbing doesn 't prepare you for a fight <eos> And that 's all the realm is now , back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing <eos> Sometimes I don 't know what holds it together <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> Our marriage <eos>

 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> Yes , it tis <eos> What was she like <question>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> You 've never asked about her , not once <eos> Why not <question>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> At first , just saying her name , even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her <eos> I thought if I didn 't talk about her , she 'd just fade away for you <eos> When I realized that wasn 't going to happen , I refused to ask out of spite <eos> I didn 't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask <eos> And eventually it became clear that my spite didn 't mean anything to you , as far as I could tell , you actually enjoyed it <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> So why now <question>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> What harm could Lyanna Stark 's ghost do to either of us that we haven 't done to each other a hundred times over <question>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> You want to know the horrible truth <question> I can 't even remember what she looked like <eos> I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted <eos> <eos> <eos> Someone took her away from me , and Seven Kingdoms couldn 't fill the hole she left behind <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> I felt something for you once , you know <question>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> I know <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while , actually <eos> Was it ever possible for us <question> Was there ever a time , ever a <eos> <eos> <eos> moment <question>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> No <eos> Does that make you feel better or worse <question>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> It doesn 't make me feel anything <eos>

 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> Don 't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak <eos> You know the law <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> It 's not my law <eos>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> They don 't belong to you <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Whatever is hers is also mine <eos>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> Once , perhaps <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> If I sell one egg , I 'll have enough to buy a ship <eos> Two eggs - a ship and an army <eos>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> And you have all three <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> I need a large army<ellipsis> I 'm the last hope of a dynasty , Mormont <eos> The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen , on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent <eos> Never <eos> Not a piece of it<ellipsis> How can I carry what I need to carry without it <question> Hmm <question> Who can rule without wealth , or fear , or love <question> Oh , you stand there , all nobility and honor <eos> You don 't think I see you looking at my little sister , hmm <question> Don 't think I know what you want <question> I don 't care <eos> You can have her <eos> She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts , and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like <eos> But let me go <eos>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> You can go , but you can 't have the eggs <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> You swore an oath to me <eos> Does loyalty mean nothing to you <question>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> It means everything to me <eos>

 <boname> MORD <eoname> Noise again <exclamation>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> About the gold -
 <boname> MORD <eoname> No gold <exclamation>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Listen to me <exclamation> Listen to me <exclamation> Sometimes possession<ellipsis> is an abstract concept <eos> When they captured me they took my purse , but the gold is still mine <eos>
 <boname> MORD <eoname> Where <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Where <question> I don 't know where , but when they free me -
 <boname> MORD <eoname> You want free <question> Go be free <eos> (points out of the skycell)
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Have you ever heard the phrase <boquote>Rich as a Lannister<eoquote> <question> Of course you have <eos> You 're a smart man <eos> You know who the Lannisters are <eos> I am a Lannister <eos> Tyrion , son of Tywin <exclamation> And of course , you have also heard the phrase , <boquote>a Lannister always pays his debts <eos><eoquote> If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn , I will be in your debt <eos> I will owe you gold <eos> If you deliver the message and I live , which I very much intend to do <eos>
 <boname> MORD <eoname> What message <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Tell her I wish to confess my crimes <eos>
 <open-exp> We cut to the throne room , where Lady Arryn and her son Robin are sitting on the throne , at the helm of the room <eos> Catelyn is standing next to them , as Robin is tapping a knife against the throne itself very annoyingly <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> LYSA_ARRYN <eoname> You wish to confess your crimes <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Yes , my lady <eos> I do , my lady <eos>
 <boname> LYSA_ARRYN <eoname> Skycells always break them <eos> Speak , Imp <eos> Meet your gods as an honest man <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Where do I begin , my lords and ladies <question> I 'm a vile man , I confess it <eos> My crimes and sins are beyond counting <eos> I have lied and cheated , gambled and whored <eos> I 'm not particularly good at violence , but I 'm good at convincing others to do violence for me <eos> You want specifics , I suppose <eos> When I was seven , I saw a servant girl bathing in the river <eos> I stole her robe <eos> She was forced to return to the castle , naked and in tears <eos> I close my eyes , I can still see her tits bouncing <eos> When I was ten , I stuffed my uncle 's boots with goatshit <eos> When confronted with my crime , I blamed a squire <eos> Poor boy was flogged and<ellipsis> I escaped justice <eos> When I was twelve , I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew <eos> I flogged the one-eyed snake <eos> I skinned my sausage <eos> I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew , which I do believe my sister ate <eos> At least I hope she did <eos> I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -
 <boname> LYSA_ARRYN <eoname> Silence <exclamation>
 <boname> ROBIN_ARRYN <eoname> What happened next <question> <exclamation>
 <boname> LYSA_ARRYN <eoname> What do you think you 're doing <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Confessing my crimes <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> Lord Tyrion , you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed , and of conspiring to murder my sister 's husband; Lord Jon Arryn , the Hand of the King <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Oh , I 'm very sorry <eos> I don 't know anything about all that <eos>
 <boname> LYSA_ARRYN <eoname> You 've had your little joke <eos> I trust you enjoyed it <eos> Mord , take him back to the dungeon <eos> But this time find a smaller cell , with a steeper floor <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Is this how justice is done in the Vale <question> you accuse me of crimes , I deny them , so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve <question> Where is the King 's Justice <question> I 'm accused and demand a trial <eos>
 <boname> LYSA_ARRYN <eoname> If you 're tried and found guilty , then by the king 's own laws you will pay with your life <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> I understand the law <eos>
 <boname> LYSA_ARRYN <eoname> We have no executioner in the Eyrie <eos> Life is more elegant here <eos> Open the Moon Door <eos>
 <open-exp> Several men begin unwinding a giant crank on one side of the room <eos> In between Tyrion and the raised throne is what looks like a well <eos> The well 's floor begins to open and wind comes howling through <eos> Robin begins giggling and rapidly clapping his hands <eos> Tyrion looks down and sees that it 's a great distance through this Moon Door to the ground , he would inevitably die if he had to go out this <boquote>door<eoquote> <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> LYSA_ARRYN <eoname> You want a trial , my Lord Lannister <eos> Very well <eos> My son will listen to whatever you have to say , and you will hear his judgement <eos> Then you will leave , by one door or the other <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> No need to bother Lord Robin <eos> I demand a trial by combat <eos>
 <open-exp> Subdued laughter fills the room , Catelyn and Lysa exchange looks <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> LYSA_ARRYN <eoname> You have that right <eos>
 <boname> KNIGHT_1 <eoname> My lady , I beg the honor <eos> Let me be your champion <eos>
 <boname> KNIGHT_2 <eoname> The honor should be mine <eos> For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death <eos>
 <boname> KNIGHT_3 <eoname> I 'll fight for you , my Lady <eos>
 <boname> KNIGHT_4 <eoname> It 'll be my honor <eos>
 <boname> KNIGHT_5 <eoname> The honor should be mine <eos>

 <boname> LYSA_ARRYN <eoname> Ser Vardis<ellipsis> You 're quiet <eos> Did you want to avenge my husband <question>
 <boname> SER_VARDIS <eoname> With all my heart , my Lady <eos> But the Imp is half my size <eos> It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Agreed <eos>
 <boname> LYSA_ARRYN <eoname> You demanded a trial by combat <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Now I demand a champion <eos> I have that right , same as you <eos>
 <boname> SER_VARDIS <eoname> My Lady , I would gladly fight the Imp 's champion for you <eos>

 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Sounds exhilarating <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Exhilarating , yes <eos> Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw <eos> (laughs) You ever fucked a Riverlands girl <question>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Once , I think <eos>

 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> You ever make the eight , Barristan <question>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> I don 't believe so , your Grace <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> (laughs) Those were the days <exclamation>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> What days were those <question> The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died <question> Or before that , when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it <question> Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground <question>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Easy , boy <eos> You might be my brother , but you 're speaking to the King <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> I suppose it was all rather heroic <eos> If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and <boquote>make the eight <eos><eoquote>

 <open-exp> In the throne room of King 's Landing <eos> Ned sits upon the throne as a fill in for Robert , as he is Hand of the King <eos> Baelish is at his right and Grand Maester Pycelle to his left <eos> The room is filled with people <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MAN <eoname> They burned most everything in the Riverlands , our fields , our granaries , our homes <eos> They took our women and then they took ‘em again <eos> When they was done , they butchered them as if they was animals <eos> They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Brigands , most likely <eos>
 <boname> MAN <eoname> They weren 't thieves , they didn 't steal nothing <eos> They even left something behind , your Grace <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> It 's the King 's Hand you 're addressing , not the king <eos> The king is hunting <eos>
 <open-exp> A second man walks forward and empties a sack out onto the floor <eos> It 's a pile of fish <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Fish <eos> The sigil of House Tully <eos> (whispers to Ned) Isn 't that your wife 's House - Tully - my Lord Hand <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> These men , were they flying a sigil <question> <ellipsis> A banner <eos>
 <boname> MAN <eoname> None , your<ellipsis> Hand <eos> The one who was leading them<ellipsis> Taller by a foot than any man I 've ever met , saw him cut the blacksmith , saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> (whisper) That sounds like someone we know <eos> The Mountain <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You 're describing Ser Gregor Clegane <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand <question> The man is an anointed knight <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> I 've heard him called <boquote>Tywin Lannister 's mad dog <eos><eoquote> I 'm sure you have as well <eos> (whispering to Ned) Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife <question>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king 's protection , it would be -
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> It would be almost abrasion as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Wel<ellipsis>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I cannot give you back your homes or restore your debt of life <eos> But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king , Robert <eos> Lord Beric Dondarrion <eos>
 <open-exp> Beric Dondarrion steps from the back of the room forward <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You shall have the command <eos> Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor 's keep <eos>
 <boname> BERIC_DONDARRION <eoname> As you command <eos>
 <open-exp> Ned stands up with the assistance of a cane <eos> He steps forward <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon , the First of his Name , King of the Andals and the First Men , Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm , I charge you to bring the king 's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes <eos> I denounce him and attaint him <eos> I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings , and sentence him to death <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> My lord<ellipsis> This<ellipsis> This is a drastic action <eos> It would be better to wait for King Robert 's return <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Grand Maester Pycelle <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> My Lord <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Send a raven to Casterly Rock <eos> Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen <eos> He will arrive within the fortnight , or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm <eos>
 <open-exp> The men all bow their heads in acknowledgement <eos> Ned steps down from the throne , Baelish follows him , speaking only to Ned <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> A bold move , my Lord , and admirable <eos> But is it wise to yank the lion 's tail <question> Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms <eos> Gold wins wars , not soldiers <eos>

 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Daenerys <exclamation> Where 's my sister <question>
 <open-exp> Daenerys and Jorah both look up , noticing her brother on the opposite side of the hut <eos> Drogo , on another side of the hut also sees Viserys <eos> Jorah stands up and begins walking towards Viserys <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Stop him <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Where is she <question> I 'm here for the feast <eos> The whore 's feast <eos>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> Come <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Get your hands off me <exclamation> No one touches the dragon <exclamation>
 <open-exp> A man sitting next to Drogo says something in Dothraki that makes the Khal laugh <eos> Viserys hears this and spins around <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Khal Drogo <exclamation> I 'm here for the feast <eos>
 <boname> KHAL_DROGO <eoname> (speaks Dothraki , motions to the other side of the hut)
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> Khal Drogo says there is a place for you <eos> Back there <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> That is no place for a king <eos>
 <boname> KHAL_DROGO <eoname> You are no king <eos>
 <open-exp> Viserys draws his sword , Jorah moves forward , Viserys holds his sword at Jorah <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Keep away from me <exclamation>
 <open-exp> The drums stop and now everyone in the hut is paying attention <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Viserys , please <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> There she is <eos>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> Put the sword down <eos> They 'll kill us all <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> They can 't kill us <eos> They can 't shed blood in their sacred city <eos> (moving his sword over everyone in the room , stopping on Daenerys ' stomach) But I can <eos> I want what I came for <eos> I want the crown he promised me <eos> He bought you <eos> But he never paid for you <eos>
 <open-exp> The Khal is fiercely looking at the situation as Viserys has his blade to Daenerys ' stomach <eos> A woman is translating for Drogo as Viserys speaks <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Tell him I want what was bargained for or I 'm taking you back <eos> He can keep the baby <eos> I 'll cut it out and leave it for him <eos>
 <boname> KHAL_DROGO <eoname> (speaks Dothraki)
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> What 's he saying <question>
 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> He says yes <eos> You shall have a golden crown , that men shall tremble to behold <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> That was all I wanted <eos> W-what was promised <eos>
 <open-exp> Viserys takes his blade away from Daenerys ' stomach and steps back , smiling <eos> Drogo stands up and walks to his wife , placing his hand on her belly as they exchange looks <eos> The Khal says something in Dothraki , two men instantly come up behind Viserys , each holding one of his arms <eos> One man breaks Viserys ' right arm as he screams <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> No <exclamation> You cannot touch me <exclamation> I am the dragon <exclamation> I am the dragon <exclamation> I want my crown <exclamation> Ahh <exclamation>
 <open-exp> The two men force Viserys to the ground , still holding him by his arms <eos> The Khal moves towards them and mutters something in Dothraki <eos> A woman tips over a kettle that was over the fire , pouring out it 's contents <eos> Drogo throws some golden jewelry into the kettle <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> Look away Khaleesi <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> No <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> No <eos> Dany <exclamation> Dany , tell them , make them <exclamation> You can 't <exclamation>
 <open-exp> The golden jewelry is now melted down into liquid <eos> Khal Drogo lifts the kettle up and walks over towards the screaming Viserys <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Dany please <exclamation>
 <boname> KHAL_DROGO <eoname> A crown for a king <eos>
 <open-exp> Khal Drogo raises the kettle over Viserys ' head and pours out the melted gold onto his skull <eos> He screams as the hot liquid solidifies on his skull , the two men release Viserys , he instantly falls to the ground dead <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> Khaleesi<ellipsis>
 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> He was no dragon <eos> Fire cannot kill a dragon <eos>

<eoepisode> <open-exp> Trumpets sounds from the Lannister camp <eos> Going inside a tent , we see Tywin Lannister sharpening his knifes , preparing to skin a deer , while Jaime Lannister starts reading the received letter from Ned Stark <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> "Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your banner man Gregor Clegane , the Mountain"
 <open-exp> Uh , "arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the Crown <eos>" <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Poor Ned Stark <eos> Brave man , terrible judgment <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> Attacking him was stupid <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> Lannisters don 't act like fools <eos>
 <open-exp> Are you gonna say something clever <question> Go on , say something clever <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> Catelyn Stark took my brother <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> Why is he still alive <question>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> Tyrion <question>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> Ned Stark <eos>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> One of our men interfered , speared him through the leg before I could finish him <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> Why is he still alive <question>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> It wouldn 't have been clean <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> Clean <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you <eos>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> I could care less what anyone thinks of me <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> Now that 's what you want people to think of you <eos>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> It 's the truth <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> When you hear them whispering "Kingslayer" behind your back , doesn 't it bother you <question>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> Of course it bothers me <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> The lion doesn 't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep <eos>
 <open-exp> I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I 'm giving you half of our forces <eos> 30 , 000 men <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> You will bring them to Catelyn Stark 's girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> I didn 't realize you placed such a high value on my brother 's life <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> He 's a Lannister <eos> He might be the lowest of the Lannisters , but he 's one of us <eos>
 <open-exp> And every day that he remains a prisoner , the less our name commands respect <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of <eos> <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> No , it 's not an opinion , it 's a fact <exclamation>
 <open-exp> If another House can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity , we are no longer a House to be feared <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Your mother 's dead <eos> Before long I 'll be dead <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> And you and your brother and your sister and all of her children <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> All of us dead , all of us rotting in the ground <eos> It 's the family name that lives on <eos> It 's all that lives on <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Not your personal glory , not your honor , but family <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Do you understand <question> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Jaime nods gently <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> Hmm <eos>
 <open-exp> You 're blessed with abilities that few men possess <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> You are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> And you are still blessed with youth <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> And what have you done with these blessings , huh <question> You 've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> One a madman , the other a drunk <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> The future of our family will be determined in these next few months <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Or we could collapse into nothing , as the Targaryens did <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I need you to become a man you were always meant to be <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Not next year <eos> Not tomorrow <eos> Now <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Submissive as he looks , Jaime walks out of the tent <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Back at a garden in Kings Landing , we see Queen Cersei approaching the sitting Ned Stark <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CERSEI_LANNISTER <eoname> You 're in pain <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> I 've had worse , my lady <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_LANNISTER <eoname> Perhaps it 's time to go home <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> The South doesn 't seem to agree with you <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> I know the truth Jon Arryn died for <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_LANNISTER <eoname> Do you , Lord Stark <question> Is that why you called me here , to pose me riddles <question>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> Has he done this before <question>
 <boname> CERSEI_LANNISTER <eoname> Jaime would have killed him <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> My brother is worth a thousand of your friend <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> Your brother Or your lover <question>
 <boname> CERSEI_LANNISTER <eoname> The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> Jaime and I are more than brother and sister <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> We shared a womb <eos> We came into this world together <eos> We belong together <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> My son saw you with him <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_LANNISTER <eoname> Do you love your children <question>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> With all my heart <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_LANNISTER <eoname> No more than I love mine <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> And they are all Jaime 's <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_LANNISTER <eoname> Thank the Gods <eos>
 <open-exp> In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed , I finish him off in other ways <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> In the morning , he doesn 't remember <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> You 've always hated him <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_LANNISTER <eoname> Hated him <question> I worshiped him <eos>
 <open-exp> Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him , but he was mine by oath <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor , lean and fierce and black-bearded , it was the happiest moment of my life <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Then that night he crawled on top of me , stinking of wine and did what he did , what little he could do , and whispered in my ear , "Lyanna" <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> When the King returns from his hunt , I 'll tell him the truth <eos>
 <open-exp> You must be gone by then <eos> You and your children <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I will not have their blood on my hands <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Go as far away as you can , with as many men as you can <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Because wherever you go , Robert 's wrath will follow you <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CERSEI_LANNISTER <eoname> And what of my wrath , Lord Stark <question> You should have taken the realm for yourself <eos>
 <open-exp> Jaime told me about the day King 's Landing fell <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Such a sad mistake <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> I 've made many mistakes in my life , but that wasn 't one of them <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_LANNISTER <eoname> Oh , but it was <eos>
 <open-exp> When you play the Game of Thrones , you win or you die <eos> There is no middle ground <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Cersei walks off <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Littlefinger is looking outside his brothel window <eos> Seeing mothers bathing their crying children <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Seemingly in thought , he decides to close it <eos> Meanwhile , Ros and Ameca are playing with each other , while Ros is loudly moaning <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROS <eoname> Come here <eos>
 <open-exp> Oh yes , oh <eos> Oh yes yes yes <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> No no no no <exclamation> Is that what they teach you up in the North <question> And you-- wherever you 're from , do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound <question> Either of you understand a thing that I 'm saying <question>
 <boname> ROS <eoname> Yes , My Lord <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Let 's start over , shall we <question> You be the man and you be the woman <eos>
 <open-exp> Well , go ahead <eos> Slowly <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> You 're not fooling them <eos> They just paid you <eos> They know what you are <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> They know it 's all just an act <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Your job is to make them forget what they know <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> That takes time <eos> You need to Ease into it <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Go ahead <eos> Ease into it <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> He 's winning you over in spite of yourself <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> You 're starting to like this <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> He wants to believe you <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> He 's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it <eos> Why shouldn 't you <question> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> He knows he 's better than other men <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> He 's always known it deep down inside <eos> Now he has proof <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> He 's so good , he 's reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Overcoming your very nature <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROS <eoname> Why don 't you join us , My Lord <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> I 'm saving myself for another <eos>
 <boname> ROS <eoname> What she doesn 't know won 't hurt her <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> A stupid saying <eos>
 <open-exp> What we don 't know is usually what gets us killed <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROS <eoname> She must be very beautiful <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> No , not really <eos> Impeccable bloodlines though <eos>
 <boname> ROS <eoname> I do believe my lord 's in love <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> For many years <eos> Most of my life really <eos>
 <open-exp> Play with her ass <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> And she loved me too <eos> I was her little confidant , her plaything <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> She could tell me anything , anything at all <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> She told me about all the horses that she liked <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> The castle she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> A northerner with a jaw like an anvil <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> So I challenged him to a duel <eos> I mean , why not <question> I 'd read all the stories <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> In the end , she wouldn 't even let him kill me <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> "He 's just a boy" , she said <eos> "Please don 't hurt him" <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by , and off they went <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROS <eoname> Is she still married to him <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Oh no <eos> He got himself killed before the wedding <eos>
 <open-exp> And she ended up with his brother , an even more impressive specimen <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> She loves him , I 'm afraid <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> And why wouldn 't she <question> I mean , who could compare to him <question> He 's just so <eos> <eos> <eos>good <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Do you know what I learned , losing that duel <question> I learned that I 'll never win <eos> Not that way <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> That 's their game , their rules <eos> I 'm not going to fight them <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I 'm going to fuck them <eos> That 's what I know <eos> That 's what I am <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROS <eoname> And what do you want <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Oh , everything , my dear <eos> Everything there is <eos>
 <open-exp> Now wash yourselves <eos> Both of you are working tonight <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Hmm <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> While Ros and Ameca are both walking out , Littlefinger watches them leave <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Back at Winterfell , Osha is walking into a stable , carrying a bale of straw <eos> While bending over and laying down the bale of sraw , Theon Grayjoy arrives <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> You 're a very lucky girl <eos> Do you know that <question>
 <open-exp> Where I come from , we don 't show mercy to criminals <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Where I come from , if someone like you attacked a little lord , at low tide we 'd lay you on your back on the beach , your hands and feet chained to four stakes <eos> The sea would come in closer and closer <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> You 'd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> Where is it you come from <question>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> The Iron Islands <eos>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> They far away <question>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> You 've never heard of the Iron Islands <question>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> Trust me , you 've never heard where I 'm from neither <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Trust me , My Lord <eos> You 're not living in the wilderness anymore <eos>
 <open-exp> In civilized lands , you refer to your betters by their proper titles <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> And what 's that <question>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Lord <eos>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> Why <question>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Why <question> What do you mean why <question> My father is Balon Greyjoy , Lord of the Iron Islands <eos>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> What 's that got to do with you <question> If your father 's lord , how can you be lord too <question>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> I will be lord after my father <eos>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> So you 're not lord now <question>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> No , you <eos> <eos> <eos>You having a go at me <question> Is that it <question>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> I just don 't understand how you Southerners do things <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> I 'm not a Southerner <eos>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> You 're from South of the wall <eos> That makes you a Southerner to me <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> You 're an impudent little wench , aren 't you <question>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> Couldn 't say , My Lord <eos> Don 't know what "impunent" means <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Impudent <eos> It means rude <eos> Disrespectful <eos>
 <open-exp> Do you want to lose that chain <question> <close-exp>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> Theon Greyjoy <exclamation> The lady is our guest <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> I thought she was our prisoner <eos>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience <question>
 <open-exp> Agitated as he is , Theon runs off <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> Chances are I won 't be nearby the next time that happens <eos>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> I 'm used to worse than him <eos>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> I 'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones <eos>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> Why did you come here <question>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> Didn 't mean to come here <eos> Meant to get much further South than this <eos>
 <open-exp> As far South as South goes , before the long night comes <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> Why <question> What are you afraid of <question>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> There 's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night <eos>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> Owls and Shadowcats and <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> I 'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats <eos>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> The "things" you speak of-- they 've been gone for thousands of years <eos>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> They wasn 't gone , old man <eos> They was sleeping <eos>
 <open-exp> And they ain 't sleeping no more <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Seeing the wall from above , we see Jon and Sam walking towards the edge <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> I miss girls <eos>
 <open-exp> Not even talking to them <eos> I never talked to them <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Just looking at them , hearing them giggle <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Don 't you miss girls <question> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Both Jon and Sam are looking down and see a galloping horse <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Riders <eos> The horn <eos> We have to blow the horn <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Why is he alone <question>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> One blast for a Ranger returning , two for Wildlings , three for <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> There 's no rider <eos>
 <open-exp> While the Wall 's gate is being opened , the horse gallops inside the tunnel <eos> Jon and Sam are rushing down , while the stable boy has caught the horse , bringing him towards Jon , Sam and Jeor Mormont <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NIGHT_WATCH_STABLE_BOY <eoname> Whoa , boy , whoa <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> That 's my Uncle Benjen 's horse <eos>
 <open-exp> Where 's my Uncle <question> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Returning to Kings Landing , we see Ned and Tomard walking down a hallway <eos> Renly running towards them calling <eos> <eos> <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Ned <exclamation> It 's Robert <eos>
 <open-exp> We were hunting <eos> <eos> <eos>a boar <eos> <eos> <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Surprised yet being shocked as he is , Ned walks towards Robert 's chambers <eos> Inside Robert 's room , we see Cersei , Joffrey , Barristan Selmy and Maester Pycelle are all present <eos> Robert speaks to joffrey , whom is sitting beside him <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> I should have spent more time with you , shown you how to be a man <eos>
 <open-exp> I was never meant to be a father <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Go on <eos> You don 't want to see this <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Joffrey walks out of the room <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> My fault <eos> Too much wine , missed my thrust <eos>
 <open-exp> It stinks <eos> It stinks like death <eos> Don 't think I can 't smell it <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I paid the bastard back , Ned <eos> I drove my knife right through his brain <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> You ask them if I didn 't <eos> Ask them <exclamation> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> And I want everyone to taste the boar that got me <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Now leave us , the lot of you <eos> I need to talk to Ned <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CERSEI_LANNISTER <eoname> Robert , my sweet <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Out , all of you <exclamation>
 <open-exp> On Robert 's demand , everyone left except for Ned <eos> As soon as the door shuts , Ned talks to Robert <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> You damned fool <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Paper and ink on the table , write down what I say <eos>
 <open-exp> "In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon , first of <eos> <eos> <eos>" you know how it goes <eos> Fill in the damn titles <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> "I hereby command Eddard of House Stark" titles , titles <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> "To serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm upon my death <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> To rule in my stead , until my son Joffrey comes of age" <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Give it over <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Ned hands over the letter and quill <eos> It is seen that Robert 's signs the letter with his autograph <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Give it to the council after I 'm dead <eos>
 <open-exp> At least they 'll say I did this right , this one thing <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> You 'll rule now <eos> You 'll hate it worse than I did , but you 'll do it well <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> The girl , Daenerys <eos> You were right <eos> Varys , Littlefinger , my brother <eos> Worthless <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> No one to tell me "no" but you <eos> Only you <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Let her live <eos> Stop it , if it 's not too late <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> I will <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> And my son Help him , Ned <eos> Make him better than me <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> I 'll , I 'll do everything I can to honor your memory <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> My memory <eos>
 <open-exp> King Robert Baratheon , murdered by a pig <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Give me something for the pain and let me die <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Ned walks out of Robert 's chamber <eos> Maester Pycelle , Renly , Varys and Barristan Selmy are waiting outside <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> Give him milk of the poppy <eos>
 <open-exp> Both Maester Pycelle as Renly re-enter Robert 's chamber <eos> Still outside a conversation occurs <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> He was reeling from the wine <eos>
 <open-exp> He commanded us to step aside , but I failed him <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> No man could have protected him from himself <eos>
 <boname> LORD_VARYS <eoname> I wonder , Ser Barristan , who gave the king this wine <question>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> His squire , from the king 's own skin <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> His squire <question> The Lannister boy <question>
 <boname> LORD_VARYS <eoname> Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment <eos>
 <open-exp> I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen <eos>
 <open-exp> Whatever arrangements you made , unmake them <eos> At once <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> LORD_VARYS <eoname> I 'm afraid those birds have flown <eos>
 <open-exp> The girl is likely dead already <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Ned walks off <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Entering Khal Drogo 's tent , Daenerys is braiding Khal Drogo 's hair <eos> The conversation is spoken in the Dothraki language <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> KHAL_DROGO <eoname> The stallion who mounts the world , has no need for iron chairs <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> According to the prophecy , the stallions will ride to the ends of the world <eos>
 <boname> KHAL_DROGO <eoname> The earth ends at the black salt sea <eos> No horse can cross the poison water <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> The earth does not end at the sea , there are many dirts beyond the sea <eos>
 <open-exp> The dirt where I was born <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> KHAL_DROGO <eoname> Not dirt <eos> Lands <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> Lands , yes <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <open-exp> There are thousands of ships in the free cities <eos> Wooden horses that fly across the sea <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> KHAL_DROGO <eoname> Let 's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> It 's not a chair <eos> It 's a <eos> <eos> <eos> Throne
 <boname> KHAL_DROGO <eoname> Throne <question>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> A chair for a King to sit upon , or a Queen <eos>
 <boname> KHAL_DROGO <eoname> A King does not need a chair to sit upon <eos> He only needs a horse <eos>
 <open-exp> Khal Drogo kisses Daenerys and walks out of the tent <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> A while later , at one of Vaes Dothrak 's markets , Daenerys walks with Jorah Mormont <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> Can 't you help me make him understand <question>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> The Dothraki do things in their own time , for their own reasons <eos>
 <open-exp> Have patience , Khaleesi <eos> We will go home , I promise you <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> My brother was a fool , I know , but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms <eos>
 <open-exp> Have I said something funny , Ser <question> <close-exp>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> Forgive me , Khaleesi , but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn 't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right <eos>
 <open-exp> He had no right to them <eos> He seized them because he could <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> And because he had dragons <eos>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> Ah well , having a few dragons makes things easier <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> You don 't believe it <eos>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> Have you ever seen a dragon , Khaleesi <question> I believe what my eyes and ears report <eos>
 <open-exp> As for the rest It was 300 years ago <eos> Who knows what really happened <question> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Now if you 'll pardon me , I 'll seek out the merchant Captain , see if he has any letters for me <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Well , I 'll come with you <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> No no , don 't trouble yourself <eos> Enjoy the market <eos> I 'll rejoin you soon enough <eos>
 <open-exp> Jorah walks by a few merchants , while a little child is calling him <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> LITTLE_BIRD <eoname> Psst , Jorah the Andal <eos>
 <open-exp> The spider sends his greetings and his congratulations <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> A royal pardon <eos> You can go home now <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Jorah seems to have a change of heart <eos> Meanwhile a merchant is heard from afar <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> WINE_MERCHANT <eoname> Virzetha gizikhven <exclamation> Mra qora <exclamation> Mra qora <exclamation>
 <open-exp> Sweet reds <exclamation> I have sweet reds from Lys , Volantis and the Arbor <exclamation> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Tyrosh pear brandy <exclamation> Andalish sours <exclamation> I have them <exclamation> I have them <exclamation> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Danaerys approaches the merchant <close-exp>
 <boname> WINE_MERCHANT <eoname> A taste for the Khaleesi <question> I have a sweet red from Dorne , my lady <eos>
 <open-exp> One taste and you 'll name your first child after me <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> My son already has his name , but I 'll try your summerwine <eos>
 <open-exp> Just a taste <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> WINE_MERCHANT <eoname> My Lady , you are from Westeros <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen <eos>
 <open-exp> Khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> WINE_MERCHANT <eoname> Princess <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> Rise <eos> I 'd still like to taste that wine <eos>
 <boname> WINE_MERCHANT <eoname> That <question> Dornish swill <eos>
 <open-exp> Not worthy of a princess <eos> I have a dry red from the Arbor <eos> Nectar of the Gods <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Let me give you a cask <eos> Uh <eos> <eos> <eos> a gift <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> You honor me , Ser <eos>
 <boname> WINE_MERCHANT <eoname> The honor <eos> <eos> <eos>the honor is all mine <eos>
 <boname> RAKHARO <eoname> Huh-uh , huh-uh <eos>
 <open-exp> Rakharo pulls the cask out of the merchants hands <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> WINE_MERCHANT <eoname> You know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return , princess <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> I hope to repay your kindness someday <eos>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> Rakharo <eos>
 <boname> RAKHARO <eoname> Huh <eos>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> Put down that cask <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> Is something wrong <question>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> I have a thirst <eos> Open it <eos>
 <boname> WINE_MERCHANT <eoname> The wine is for the Khaleesi <eos> It 's not for the likes of you <eos>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> Open it <eos>
 <open-exp> The wine merchant obeys and opens the cask <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> Pour <eos>
 <boname> WINE_MERCHANT <eoname> It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> Do as he says <eos>
 <boname> WINE_MERCHANT <eoname> As the princess commands <eos>
 <open-exp> The wine merchant poors the wine into a cup <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> WINE_MERCHANT <eoname> Sweet , isn 't it <question> Can you smell the fruit , Ser <question> Taste it , My Lord <eos>
 <open-exp> Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> You first <eos>
 <boname> WINE_MERCHANT <eoname> Me <question> I 'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage <eos>
 <open-exp> Besides , it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> You will drink <eos>
 <open-exp> The wine merchant takes Jorah 's cup <eos> Looks both Jorah and Daenerys innocently in their eyes , while making a toasting gesture <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> As soon as his lips touches his cup , he drops it and tries to flee <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> Khaleesi <exclamation> Stop him <exclamation>
 <open-exp> After a very short chase , Rakharo was able to capture the wine merchant , grabbing the merchants leg with his whip <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Jorah grabs Daenerys 's arm <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> Come <eos>
 <open-exp> At the Wall we see Jeor Mormont speaking towards his brothers of the Night 's Watch <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JEOR_MORMONT <eoname> You came to us as outlaws , poachers , rapers , killers , thieves <eos>
 <open-exp> You came alone , in chains , without friends nor honor <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> You came to us rich and you came to us poor <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Some of you bear the names of proud houses , others only bastard names or no names at all <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> It does not matter <eos> All that , is in the past <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Here , on the wall , are all one house <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Tonight <eos> <eos> <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SAMWEL_TARLY <eoname> You 're allowed to look happy <eos>
 <open-exp> You 're going to be a Ranger <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Isn 't that what you always wanted <question> <close-exp>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I want to find my Uncle <eos>
 <open-exp> I know he 's alive out there <eos> I know he is <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> I wish I could help you , but I 'm no Ranger <eos>
 <open-exp> It 's the steward 's life for me <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> There 's honor in being a steward <eos>
 <open-exp> Not much , really <eos> But there 's food <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JEOR_MORMONT <eoname> Here you begin anew <eos>
 <open-exp> A man of The Night 's Watch lives his life for the realm <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Not for a king , or a lord , or the honor of this house or that house <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Not for gold nor glory nor a woman 's love <eos> But for the realm <exclamation> And all the people in it <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> You 've all learned the words of the vow <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Think carefully before you say them <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> The penalty for desertion , is death <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> You can take your vows here tonight , at sunset <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Do any of you still keep the old Gods <question> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Jon Snow stands <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I do , my lord <eos>
 <boname> JEOR_MORMONT <eoname> You 'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Yes , my lord <eos>
 <boname> JEOR_MORMONT <eoname> You 'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall <eos> And your old Gods too , maybe <eos>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> my lord , might I go as well <question>
 <boname> JEOR_MORMONT <eoname> Does house Tarly keep the old Gods <question>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> No , my lord <eos>
 <open-exp> I was named in the light of the Seven , as my father was and his father before him <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Alliser ThorneL Why would you forsake the Gods of your father and your house <question> <close-exp>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> The Night 's Watch is my house now <eos>
 <open-exp> The Seven have never answered my prayers <eos> Perhaps the old Gods will <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JEOR_MORMONT <eoname> As you wish , lad <eos>
 <open-exp> You 've all been assigned an order , according to our needs and your strengths <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Halder to the builders <eos> Pyp to the stewards <eos> Toad to the builders <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Grenn to the Rangers <eos> Samwell to the stewards <eos> Matthar to the Rangers <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> JAREMY_RYKKER <eoname> Rangers with me <eos>
 <boname> OTHELL_YARWYCK <eoname> Builders <exclamation>
 <open-exp> Everyone walks to their designated leader <eos> Sam , Jon and Pyp walk towards Maester Aemon and await their tasks <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MAESTER_AEMON <eoname> Samwell , you will assist me in the rookery and library <eos>
 <open-exp> Pyp , you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Luke , report to one-eyed Joe in the stables <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Dareon , we are sending you to Eastwatch <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive <eos> Make no comment about his nose <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Jon Snow , Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Will I serve the Lord Commander 's meals and fetch hot water for his bath <eos>
 <boname> MAESTER_AEMON <eoname> Certainly <eos> And keep a fire burning in his chambers <eos>
 <open-exp> Change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Do you take me for a servant <question>
 <boname> MAESTER_AEMON <eoname> We took you for a man of The Night 's Watch <eos>
 <open-exp> But perhaps we were wrong in that <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> May I go <question>
 <boname> MAESTER_AEMON <eoname> As you wish <eos>
 <open-exp> Jon walks away , while Sam and Pyp follow him <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> Jon , wait <exclamation> Don 't you see what they 're doing <question>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I see Ser Alliser 's revenge , that 's all <eos>
 <open-exp> He wanted it and he got it <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Stewards are nothing but maids <exclamation> I 'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you <exclamation> It 's not fair <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> PYPAR <eoname> Fair <question> I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock <eos>
 <open-exp> I pushed him away and he said he 'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> So now I 'm here <eos> At the end of the world with no one to sing for , but old men and little shits like you <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I 'll never see my family again <eos> I 'll never be inside a woman again <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> So don 't tell me about fair <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister <question>
 <boname> PYPAR <eoname> You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock <question>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> Could you sing me a song , Pyp <question> I 'd like to hear a song <eos>
 <open-exp> Angrily Pyp walks off <eos> Sam talks to Jon <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> Now listen to me <eos> The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night 's Watch <eos>
 <open-exp> You 'll be with him day and night <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Yes , you 'll clean his clothes <eos>But you 'll also take his letters , attend him at meetings , squire for him in battle <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> You 'll know everything , be part of everything <eos> And he asked for you himself <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> He wants to groom you for command <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I just , I always wanted to be a Ranger <eos>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> I always wanted to be a Wizard <eos>
 <open-exp> Jon laughs out loud <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> What <question> No , I 'm serious <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> So you 'll stay and say your words with me <question> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> In Kings Landing we see Ned Stark walking with his guards , while Renly approaches <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Lord Stark , a moment <eos>
 <open-exp> Alone if you will <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> He named you Protector of the Realm <eos>
 <open-exp> He did <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> She won 't care <eos>
 <open-exp> Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> And what should I do with a hundred swords <question>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Strike <exclamation> Tonight while the castle sleeps <eos>
 <open-exp> We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Protector of the Realm or no , he who holds the King holds the Kingdom <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> By the time Robert dies , it will be too late for the both of us <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> What about Stannis <question>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis <question>
 <open-exp> You have odd notions about protecting the realm <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> Stannis is your older brother <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> This isn 't about the bloody line of succession <eos>
 <open-exp> That didn 't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King <eos> It shouldn 't matter now <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> What 's best for the Kingdoms <question> What 's best for the people we rule <question> We all know what Stannis is <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> He inspires no love or loyalty <eos> He 's not a King <eos> I am <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> Stannis is a commander <eos> He 's led men into war twice <eos>
 <open-exp> He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Yes , he 's a good soldier <eos> Everyone knows that <eos> So was Robert <eos>
 <boname> TELL_ME_SOMETHING <eoname> Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings <question>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> I will not dishonor Robert 's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds <eos>
 <open-exp> Ned walks off to his chamber , while Renly is left behind agitated <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Entering Ned Starks chamber , we see him writing a letter to Stannis <eos> Giving orders to Tomard <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> You will sail to dragonstone tonight <eos>
 <open-exp> You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Not his steward , not his Captain of the guard , and not his wife <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Only Stannis himself <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TOMARD <eoname> Yes , My Lord <eos>
 <open-exp> Littlefinger enters the room <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> Now leave us <eos>
 <open-exp> Tomard follows Ned 's command and leaves his chamber <eos> Littlefingers starts off the conversation <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> My Lord protector <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> The King has no true born sons <eos>
 <open-exp> Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister 's bastards <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> So when the King dies <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> So it would seem <eos> Unless <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> There is no "unless" <eos>
 <open-exp> He is the rightful heir <eos> Nothing can change that <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> And he cannot take the throne without your help <eos>
 <open-exp> You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> Do you have a shred of honor <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm <eos>
 <open-exp> All of the power is yours <eos> You need only reach out and take it <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Make peace with the Lannisters <eos> Release the Imp <eos> Wed your daughter to Joffrey <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> We have plenty of time to get rid of Stannis <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> And if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne , we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> We <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> You 'll need someone to share these burdens <eos> I assure you , my price would be modest <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> What you suggest is treason <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Only if we lose <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> Make peace with the Lannisters , you say <eos> With the people who tried to murder my boy <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> We only make peace with our enemies , my Lord <eos>
 <open-exp> That 's why it 's called "making peace" <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> No <eos> I won 't do it <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> So it will be Stannis and war <question>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> There is no other choice <eos> He is the heir <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> So why did you call me here <question> Not for my wisdom , clearly <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> You promised Catelyn you would help me <eos>
 <open-exp> The Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard <eos> I need the gold cloaks <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> The City Watch is 2 , 000 strong and sworn to defend the King 's peace <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Look at you <eos> You know what you want me to do <eos>
 <open-exp> You know it has to be done , but it 's not honorable so the words stick in your throat <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> When the Queen proclaims one King and the Hand proclaims another , whose peace do the Gold Cloaks protect <question> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Who do they follow <question> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> The man who pays them <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Back at the Wall , we see Jon , Sam and Ghost , walking with a few Night 's Watch brothers , on their way to the Weirwood tree <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Upon arrival , they 're taking their vows <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BOTH_JON_AND_SAM <eoname> Hear my words and bear witness to my vow <eos>
 <open-exp> Night gathers and now my watch begins <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> It shall not end until my death <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I shall take no wife , hold no lands , father no children <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I shall wear no crowns and win no glory <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I shall live and die at my post <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I am the sword in the darkness <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I am the watcher on the walls <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I am the shield that guards the realms of men <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I pledge my life and honor to The Night 's Watch , for this night and all the nights to come <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> OTHELL_YARWYCK <eoname> You knelt as boys <eos>
 <open-exp> Rise now as men of The Night 's Watch <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Ghost suddenly appears and is holding onto something <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> What 's he got there <question>
 <open-exp> Jon SnowL To me , Ghost <eos> Bring it here <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> It appeared that Ghost was holding a frozen hand <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> Gods be good <exclamation>
 <open-exp> Returning to a tent in Vaes Dothrak , both Daenarys and Jorah are having a conversation , while walking past the captured wine merchant <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAENERYS_STORMBORN <eoname> What will they do to him <question>
 <open-exp> When the Khalasar rides , he 'll be leashed to a saddle , forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> SEPTA_MORDANE <eoname> Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today <eos>
 <open-exp> How she could forget <eos> <eos> <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> She didn 't forget <eos> She 's with her dancing master <eos>
 <open-exp> She 's with him every morning <eos> She always comes back with scrapes and bruises <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> My tongue lied <eos>
 <open-exp> My eyes shouted the truth <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> You were not seeing <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> I was so <eos> I watched , but you <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> watching is not seeing , dead girl <eos>
 <open-exp> The seeing , the true seeing , that is the heart of swordplay <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> The Kings guard approaches <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MERYN_TRANT <eoname> Arya Stark , come with us <eos>
 <open-exp> Your father wants to see you <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own <question> I am wondering <eos>
 <boname> MERYN_TRANT <eoname> Mind your place , dancing master <eos>
 <open-exp> This is no concern of yours <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> My father wouldn 't send you <eos>
 <open-exp> As she picks up her wooden stick from the ground , she says <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> And I don 't have to go with you if I don 't want <eos>
 <boname> MARYN_TRANT <eoname> Take her <eos>
 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> Are you men or snakes , that you would threaten a child <question>
 <boname> KINGS_GUARD <eoname> Get out of my way , little man <eos>
 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> I am Syrio Forel <eos>
 <boname> KINGS_GUARD <eoname> Foreign bastard <eos>
 <open-exp> The Kings guard draws his sword <eos> Before he can strike , Syrio hits him with his wooden stick <eos> Knocking him out <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> And you will be speaking to me with more respect <eos>
 <boname> MERYN_TRANT <eoname> Kill the Braavosi <eos> Bring the girl <eos>
 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> Arya child , we are done with dancing for the day <eos>
 <open-exp> Run to your father <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Syrio Forel fights three Kings guards at once , eventually knocking them all out <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MERYN_TRANT <eoname> Bloody oafs <eos>
 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> Be gone now , Arya <eos>
 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> Come with me <eos> Run <eos>
 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> The first sword of Braavos does not run <eos>
 <open-exp> Meryn Trant strikes Syrio , a short duel takes place <eos> Eventually Meryn Trant cuts Syrio Forel 's wooden sword into pieces <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> What do we say to the God of death <question>
 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> Not today <eos>
 <boname> SYRIO_FOREL <eoname> Go <eos>
 <open-exp> Arya Stark runs off and hears a bunch of screams from down the hallway <eos> She looks concerned <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> Not today <eos> Not today <eos>
 <open-exp> Back on the other side of the Red Keep , Sansa runs on , but is stopped by a familiar face <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> Stay away from me <eos>
 <open-exp> I 'll tell my father <eos> I 'll <eos> <eos> <eos>I 'll tell the Queen <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SANDOR_CLEGANE <eoname> Who do you think sent me <question>
 <open-exp> Back to Arya , we see that she has arrived at the slaughtered stewards <eos> She sees her belongings lying on the ground <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> Needle <eos>
 <open-exp> A stable boy appears <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> STABLE_BOY <eoname> There she is <eos>

 <boname> STABLE_BOY <eoname> She 'll reward me , the Queen <exclamation>
 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> Stay away <exclamation>
 <open-exp> Accidentally , she turns around sliding Needle through the stable boys belly <eos> Her first kill is a fact <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Shook as she is , she runs off <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> In the dark dungeon cells of Kings Landing we see Ned Stark <eos> He sees a little light approaches him <eos> After a short while it is clear that it 's Varys , whom is holding a torch <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> LORD_VARYS <eoname> Lord Stark , you must be thirsty <eos>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> Varys <eos>
 <boname> LORD_VARYS <eoname> I promise you it isn 't poisoned <eos>
 <open-exp> Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch <question> Not so much , My Lord <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I would save the rest , if I were you <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Hide it <eos> Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> What about my daughters <question>
 <boname> LORD_VARYS <eoname> The younger one seems to have escaped the castle <eos>
 <open-exp> Even my little birds cannot find her <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> And Sansa <question>
 <boname> LORD_VARYS <eoname> Still engaged to Joffrey <eos>
 <open-exp> Cersei will keep her close <eos> The rest of your household though , all dead , it grieves me to say <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I do so hate the sight of blood <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing <eos>
 <boname> LORD_VARYS <eoname> And would again , My Lord <eos>
 <open-exp> I was unarmed , unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> When you look at me do you see a hero <question> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey 's birth <question> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> The madness of mercy <eos> That she might save her children <eos>
 <boname> LORD_VARYS <eoname> Ah , the children <eos> It is always the innocents who suffer <eos>
 <open-exp> It wasn 't the wine that killed Robert , nor the boar <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open , but it was your mercy that killed the King <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> I trust you know you are a dead man , Lord Eddard <question> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> The Queen can 't kill me <eos> Cat holds her brother <eos>
 <boname> LORD_VARYS <eoname> The wrong brother sadly <eos>
 <open-exp> And lost to her <eos> Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> If that 's true , then slit my throat and be done with it <eos>
 <boname> LORD_VARYS <eoname> Not today , My Lord <eos>
 <open-exp> Varys is about to walk away , while being stopped by Ned one last time <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> NED_STARK <eoname> Tell me something , Varys <eos>
 <open-exp> Who do you truly serve <question> <close-exp>
 <boname> LORD_VARYS <eoname> The Realm , My Lord <eos>

 <boname> OTHELL_YARWYCK <eoname> Snow 's not wrong , My Lord <eos>
 <open-exp> Fire will do for them <eos> The Wildling way <eos> <close-exp>

 <open-exp> Jon points to the letter , as he wants to read it <eos> Jeor Mormont hands it over <eos> When reading the letter , Jon stands up and wants to walk away <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JEOR_MORMONT <eoname> I hope you 're not thinking of doing anything stupid <eos>

 <boname> LORD_VARYS <eoname> Your father has proved to be an awful traitor , dear <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> King Robert 's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey 's rightful throne <eos>

 <open-exp> We know that <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Yet you are the daughter of a traitor <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> How can I allow you to marry my son <question> <close-exp>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> A child born of a traitor 's seed is no fit consort for our King <eos>
 <open-exp> She is a sweet thing now , Your Grace , but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch <question> <close-exp>
 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> No , I 'm not <eos>

 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> If <eos> <eos> <eos>if I could see my father , talk to him about <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_LANNISTER <eoname> You disappoint me , child <eos>
 <open-exp> We have told you of your father 's treason <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Why would you want to speak to a traitor <question> <close-exp>
 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> I only meant that <eos> <eos> <eos>what will happen to him <question>

 <boname> MIRRI_MAZ_DUUR <eoname> My mother was Godswife here before me <eos>
 <open-exp> She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> All men are of one flock , so my people believe <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his <eos> <eos> <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Qotho slaps "the witch" and says <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> QOTHO <eoname> Too many words <eos> A witch 's words poison the ears <eos>
 <boname> MIRRI_MAZ_DUUR <eoname> lamb or lion , his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester <eos>
 <boname> DAENARYS_STORMBORN <eoname> Let her clean your wound , my sun and stars <eos>

 <open-exp> Khal Drogo lays eyes upon "the witch" <eos> While he 's seemingly in thought , "the witch" approaches him <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> As Dany steps aside , she looks at Khal Drogo 's wound <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Entering Winterfell , gathered Stark banner men are having a feast <eos> <close-exp>

 <open-exp> While Greatjon Umber raises his voice to Robb , Grey Wind rushes towards him and attacks , biting off 2 of his fingers <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your Liege Lord <eos>
 <open-exp> But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> GREATJON_UMBER <eoname> Your meat <eos> <eos> <eos>is bloody tough <eos>
 <open-exp> Greatjon Umber starts laughing breaking the tension , making everyone laughing along with him <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> RICKON_STARK <eoname> No , they won 't <eos>
 <open-exp> Rickon turns arond and leaves the room <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> The next morning , Brann is sitting affront of the Weirwood tree <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> While saying his prayers , Osha approaches him <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRANN_STARK <eoname> Please watch over Robb <eos>
 <open-exp> And watch over all the other men from Winterfell <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> And Theon too , I suppose <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> You hear them , boy <question> The Old Gods are answering you <eos>

 <open-exp> Beyond the Wall , they 're the only Gods <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Even slaves are allowed to pray <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRANN_STARK <eoname> You 're not a slave <eos>
 <open-exp> Osha points out to her chains and wiggles her foot <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRANN_STARK <eoname> Well , your friend did put a knife to my throat <eos>
 <open-exp> I 'm not complaining , Little Lord , just telling truths <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> OSHA <eoname> You asked them , they 're answering you <eos>
 <open-exp> Shh <eos> Open your ears <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Brann is trying to listen and looks up the Weirwood tree <eos> He hears the wind blowing through the leaves <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRANN_STARK <eoname> It 's only the wind <eos>
 <open-exp> Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods <question> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> They see you , boy <eos> They hear you <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Your brother will get no help from them where he 's going <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> The Old Gods have no power in the South <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> How can they watch when they have no eyes <question> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Suddenly Hodor appears <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> It appears he was bathing nearby , since he is bare naked holding a towel around his neck <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> OSHA <eoname> Well , there 's a big man <eos>

 <boname> OSHA <eoname> Giants and worse than giants <eos>
 <open-exp> I tried telling your brother , he 's marching the wrong way <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> All these swords , they should be going North , boy <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> North , not south <exclamation> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> The cold winds are rising <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Looking back up to the Weirwood tree , Brann hears the wind again <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> At castle Black , the Night 's Watch decided to burn the corpse of Othor , whom attacked Jeor Mormant <eos> <close-exp>

 <open-exp> That 's why they came back <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> That 's why their eyes turned blue <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Only fire will stop them <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> How do you know that <question>

 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> you would never be allowed to leave <eos> No <eos>
 <open-exp> Our best hope , our only hope , is that you can defeat them in the field <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> And if I lose <question>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children , when the Mad King fell <question>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> They were butchered in their sleep <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> On the orders of Tywin Lannister <eos> And the years have not made him kinder <eos>
 <open-exp> If you lose , your father dies , your sisters die , we die <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> Well , that makes it simple then <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> I suppose it does <eos>
 <open-exp> Arriving at the foot of the Lannister camp , Tyrion , Bronn , Shagga and the hill tribe , decide to stop for a short while <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> A conversation follows <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone <eos>
 <boname> SHAGGA <eoname> Best for Tyrion son of Tywin <eos> Not best for me <eos>
 <open-exp> If the half man betrays us , Shagga son of Dolf will cut off his manhood <eos> <eos> <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> And feed it to the goats , yes <eos>
 <open-exp> All right then <eos> Time to meet my father <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Moving into the Lannister camp , Shagga and the hill tribe follow <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Upon entering the Tywin Lannister 's tent , we see Kevan Lannister and Tywin sitting at a table , scheming <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Kevan Lannister Tyrion <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Uncle <eos> Father <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> The rumors of your demise were unfounded <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Sorry to disappoint you <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> And who are these Companions of yours <question>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> This is Shagga Son of Dolf , Chieftain of the Stone Crows <eos>
 <open-exp> Timett Son of Timett , ruler of the Burned Men <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk , leader of the Black Ears <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> And here we have Bronn son of <eos> <eos> <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> You wouldn 't know him <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> May I present My Lord Father , Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister <eos>
 <open-exp> Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West <eos> Kind of you to go to war for me <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> You left us no choice <eos> The honor of the House was at stake <eos>
 <open-exp> Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> We have our differences , Jaime and I <eos>
 <open-exp> He 's braver <eos> I 'm better looking <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JAMIE_LANNISTER <eoname> He 's been covering himself in glory <eos>
 <boname> KEVAN_LANNISTER <eoname> Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth , and now lays siege to Riverrun , Catelyn Stark 's homeland <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> And the Starks <question> Lord Eddard <question>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> Is our hostage <eos>
 <open-exp> He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned <question>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> Robert Baratheon is dead <eos>
 <open-exp> Joffrey rules in King 's Landing <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> My sister rules , you mean <eos>
 <boname> KEVAN_LANNISTER <eoname> Stark 's son has called his banners <eos>
 <open-exp> He moves south with a strong host <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> A green boy <eos>
 <open-exp> One taste of battle and he 'll run back to Winterfell wi his tail between his legs <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Maybe <eos> Though the boy does have a certain belligerence <eos>
 <open-exp> You 'd like him <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> While we 're on the subject of war , I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> We shall require 3 , 000 helms and shields , plus swords , pikes , gorgets , maces <eos> <eos> <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Suddenly a messenger appears , interrupting Tyrion 's request <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MESSENGER <eoname> If it please My Lord , Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> The wolf rushes into the lion 's jaws <eos>
 <open-exp> So be it <eos> Kevan , command the drummers beat assembly <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> KEVAN_LANNISTER <eoname> At once , My Lord <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN_LANNISTER <eoname> It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors <eos>
 <open-exp> Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SHAGGA <eoname> Only if the half man fights with us <eos>
 <open-exp> Until we hold the steel he pledged us , the little lion 's life is ours <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Tywin looks over to Tyrion <eos> Tyrion looks shooked <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Back at Robbs camp , inside his tent we see Robb and his men plotting <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> RODRIK_CASSAL <eoname> The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north <eos>
 <open-exp> We need to get him on broken ground , put his Knights at a disadvantage <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> GREATJON_UMBER <eoname> No , we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister 's siege of Riverrun <eos>
 <open-exp> Do that and the River Lords will join us <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Lord Frey controls that bridge <eos>
 <open-exp> Your father 's bannerman <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> "The late Lord Frey" my father calls him <eos>
 <open-exp> At the Trident , he didn 't appear until the battle was done <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Meanwhile , outside a few Stark men captured a scout , leading him to Robbs tent <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Robb 's right <eos>
 <open-exp> We need that bridge <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> GREATJON_UMBER <eoname> So what 's it gonna be <question> Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin <question>
 <boname> STARK_GUARD <eoname> Your pardon , my lords <eos>
 <open-exp> We 've captured a Lannister scout <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Theon covers the map with pawns <close-exp>
 <boname> GREATJON_UMBER <eoname> Don 't worry , lad <eos>
 <open-exp> He won 't be leaving this tent with his head <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> Where did you find him <question>
 <boname> STARK_GUARD <eoname> In the brush above the encampment <eos>
 <open-exp> He looked to be counting <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Robb walks towards the Lannister scout <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> How high did you get <question>
 <boname> LANNISTER_SCOUT <eoname> 20 , 000 <eos> Maybe more <eos>
 <open-exp> Rodrik Cassel You don 't have to do this yourself <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Your father would understand <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> My father understands mercy , when there is room for it <eos>
 <open-exp> And he understands honor and courage <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Let him go <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> Robb <eos>
 <open-exp> Robb looks over his shoulder with a stare <eos> Catelyn understands and looks down in regret <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> Tell Lord Tywin , Winter is coming for him <eos>
 <open-exp> To find out if he really does shit gold <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> LANNISTER_SCOUT <eoname> Yes , My Lord <eos> Thank you , My Lord <eos>
 <boname> GREATJON_UMBER <eoname> Are you touched , boy <question> <exclamation> Letting him go <question>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> You call me boy again <eos>
 <open-exp> Greatjon Umber wants to taunt Robb <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> Go on <eos>
 <boname> GREATJON_UMBER <eoname> Oi <eos>
 <open-exp> Frustrated , Greatjon Umber walks out of the tent <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> In Kings Landing , we see Ned Stark asleep in the dungeons , a guard on patrol kicks his feet waking him up <eos> Then walks on <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Meanwhile , in the Throne room , new roles are being announced by Grand Maester Pycelle <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> It is also the wish of His Grace , that his loyal servant Janos Slynt , Commander of the City Watch <eos> <eos> <eos>

 <open-exp> In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark , it is the wish of his Grace that Tywin Lannister , Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West , be appointed Hand of the King <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Lastly , in these times of treason and turmoil , it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CERSEI_LANNISTER <eoname> Ser Barristan Selmy <eos>
 <open-exp> Barristan Selmy approaches <eos> <close-exp>

 <open-exp> It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> Your Grace , the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood <eos>
 <open-exp> Our vows are taken for life <eos> Only death relieves us of our sacred trust <eos> <close-exp>

 <open-exp> You 're too old to protect anybody <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> Your Grace <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_LANNISTER <eoname> The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard <eos>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend <exclamation>

 <open-exp> Sansa kneels down <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> As it please Your Grace , I ask mercy for my father , Lord Eddard Stark , who was Hand of the King <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Treason is a noxious weed <eos>

 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> Thank you , Your Grace <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Do you deny your father 's crime <question>
 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> No , My Lords <eos> I know he must be punished <eos>
 <open-exp> All I ask is mercy <eos> I know My Lord father must regret what he did <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> He was King Robert 's friend and he loved him <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> You all know he loved him <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> They must have lied to him <eos> Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> They must have lied <exclamation> <close-exp>
 <boname> KING_JOFFREY <eoname> He said I wasn 't the King <eos> Why did he say that <question>
 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> He was badly hurt <eos>
 <open-exp> Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> KING_JOFFREY <eoname> Your sweet words have moved me <eos>
 <open-exp> But your father has to confess <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> He has to confess and say that I 'm the King or there 'll be no mercy for him <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> He will <eos>
<eoepisode> <open-exp> Opening Credits <close-exp>
 <open-exp> First scene shows the location of Casterly Rock (ancestral seat of House Lannister) on a giant map of Westeros <eos> There are several game pieces representing different House sigils located on different parts of the map <eos> ROBB STARK and CATELYN STARK are at a campsite , within a tent lit up by candles <close-exp>
 <boname> CATELYN <eoname> Are you sure about this <question>
 <boname> ROBB <eoname> No <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN <eoname> It 's dangerous <eos>
 <open-exp> ROBB nods in agreement <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB <eoname> If we take Tywin 's castle from him , the lords of Westeros will realize he 's not invincible <eos> Take his home , take his gold , take his power <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN <eoname> Why are you telling me <question>
 <open-exp> ROBB pauses then walks around CATELYN <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB <eoname> You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice <eos>
 <open-exp> ROBB pours himself something to drink <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB <eoname> Now Winterfell is burned to the ground <eos> The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone <eos>
 <open-exp> ROBB pauses <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB <eoname> So , Casterly Rock <question> I 'm asking your advice <eos>
 <open-exp> CATELYN pauses , staring at ROBB <eos> She then looks at the map <close-exp>
 <boname> CATELYN <eoname> We have enough men <question>
 <open-exp> ROBB grabs a House Frey piece <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB <eoname> If Walder Frey cooperates <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN <eoname> If Walder Frey cooperates <eos>
 <open-exp> Close up shots of the map showing the sigils of House Stark , House Frey and House Lannister <close-exp>
 <boname> CATELYN <eoname> If reinforcements arrive from King 's Landing , before we take the castle , we 'll be caught between Tywin 's army and the sea <eos>
 <open-exp> ROBB moves the House Frey piece to the House Stark side of the map <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB <eoname> We 'll lose the war and die the way father died <eos> Or worse <eos>
 <open-exp> A flash of anger spreads across CATELYN 's face <close-exp>
 <boname> CATELYN <eoname> Show them how it feels to lose what they love <eos>
 <open-exp> The scene shifts to the inside of The Twins , as a servant walks around with a plate of bread and salt in observation of the Westerosi tradition of "Guest Right" <eos> ROBB , his wife TALISA MAEGYR , his uncle EDMURE TULLY , his great uncle BRYNDEN "BLACKFISH" TULLY , CATELYN and the Stark army are in the presence of WALDER FREY and his family <eos> ROBB takes a piece of bread , dips it into the salt and eats it while looking intently at WALDER <close-exp>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> My honored guests , be welcome within my walls and at my table <eos> I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven <eos>
 <boname> ROBB <eoname> We thank you for your hospitality , my lord <eos>
 <open-exp> Servant stops in front of WALDER <eos> He takes a piece of bread from the plate and eats it <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB <eoname> I have come to make my apologies , my lord , and to beg your forgiveness <eos>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> Don 't beg my forgiveness , your Grace <eos> It wasn 't me you spurned , it was my girls <eos>
 <open-exp> WALDER signals for his female relatives to appear before ROBB <close-exp>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> One of them was supposed to be queen , now none of them are <eos>
 <open-exp> As WALDER calls each relative by name , they briefly look up at ROBB <close-exp>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> This is Arwyn , my daughter <eos> My daughter Walda , my daughter Derwa , my daughter Waldra <eos>
 <open-exp> WALDER pauses to chew <close-exp>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila <eos>
 <open-exp> EDMURE intently watches the Frey women <close-exp>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> Serra and Sarra , granddaughters , twins <eos> You could have had either <eos> Could have had both for all I care <eos>
 <open-exp> EDMURE closes his eyes after hearing WALDER 'S comments about his granddaughters <close-exp>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> My granddaughter Marianne <eos> My granddaughter Freya <eos> My granddaughter <eos> <eos> <eos>W-W-Wertha <question> Waldra <question> Waldina <question>
 <open-exp> WALDER guessing at his granddaughter 's name <eos> EDMURE raises his eyebrows <close-exp>
 <boname> MERRY <eoname> I 'm Merry <eos>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> Fine <eos> And here 's my youngest daughter Shirei , though she hasn 't bled yet <eos> Clearly you don 't have the patience for all that <eos>
 <open-exp> ROBB looks at the Frey women <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB <eoname> My ladies <eos> All men should keep their word , kings most of all <eos> I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow <eos> The fault is not with you <eos> Any man would be lucky to have any one of you <eos> I did what I did not to slight you , but because I loved another <eos> I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house <eos> I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends <eos>
 <open-exp> WALDER claps to signal the dismissal of the Frey women <close-exp>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> Very good <eos>
 <open-exp> WALDER focuses on TALISA <close-exp>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> There she is <eos> Come closer , let me have a look at you <eos>
 <open-exp> TALISA takes a couple of steps towards WALDER <eos> WALDER moves forward in his seat and squints <close-exp>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> Still can 't see you <eos> Old eyes <eos>
 <open-exp> TALISA looks at ROBB who nods <eos> Frey men look on as she takes a couple more steps towards WALDER <eos> She bows her head <close-exp>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> Love <eos> That 's what the Starks of Winterfell call it , eh <question> Heh <eos> Very honorable , I call it a pretty face <eos> Mmmm , very pretty <eos> Prettier than this lot , that 's for sure <eos> Very shapely as well <eos> Oh , you try to hide her under that dress <eos> If you wanted to hide her , you shouldn 't have brought her here in the first place <eos>
 <open-exp> WALDER leans forward with a grin <close-exp>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> I can always see what 's going on beneath a dress <eos> Been at this a long time <eos> I bet when you take that dress off , everything stays right where it is <eos> Doesn 't drop an inch <eos>
 <open-exp> WALDER grins , ROBB visibly uncomfortable <close-exp>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> Your king says he betrayed me for love <eos> I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit <eos>
 <open-exp> ROBB starts to step forward before CATELYN stops him <close-exp>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> And I can respect that <eos> When I was your age , I 'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought <eos> Well , I 've enough room in the hall for you lot <eos> We 'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men <eos>
 <open-exp> ROBB visibly angry <close-exp>
 <boname> ROBB <eoname> Thank you , my lord <eos>
 <open-exp> WALDER stands up and claps <close-exp>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> Well , let 's get ready <eos> The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we 'll put this mess behind us <eos>
 <open-exp> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <close-exp>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Where <question>
 <open-exp> DAARIO points at a location on the map <close-exp>
 <boname> DAARIO <eoname> There <eos>
 <open-exp> DAARIO gets closer to DAENERYS , grabs and guides her hand to the location he was referring to <eos> JORAH watches him closely <close-exp>
 <boname> DAARIO <eoname> There , it 's a back gate <eos> My men use it when they visit Yunkai 's bed slaves <eos>
 <boname> JORAH <eoname> Your men but not you <question>
 <boname> DAARIO <eoname> I have no interest in slaves <eos> A man cannot make love to property <eos>
 <open-exp> DAENERYS briefly looks up at DAARIO and JORAH briefly looks at her <close-exp>
 <boname> DAARIO <eoname> This is where we enter the city <eos> Very few guards , they know me <eos> They let me inside <eos>
 <boname> BARRISTAN <eoname> We 're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate <eos>
 <boname> DAARIO <eoname> I kill the guards <eos> I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets , which I know well , and open the front gates <eos>
 <open-exp> DAARIO nods at JORAH and GREY WORM <eos> JORAH looks at GREY WORM who briefly looks back <close-exp>
 <boname> DAARIO <eoname> Then comes the army <eos> Once the walls are breached , the city will fall in hours <eos>
 <boname> JORAH <eoname> Or perhaps you 'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter , cutting the head off our army <eos> The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won 't have to split it three ways cause you 've already slaughtered your partners <eos>
 <boname> DAARIO <eoname> You have a very suspicious mind <eos> In my experience , only dishonest people think this way <eos>
 <open-exp> JORAH sighs and looks at Grey Worm <close-exp>
 <boname> JORAH <eoname> You command the Unsullied <eos> What do you think <question>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> <open-brack> Speaking to Grey Worm in Valyrian <close-brack> Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza , iderenna qopsa verdagon issa <eos>
 <boname> GREY_WORM <eoname> <open-brack> In Valyrian <close-brack> I trust him <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> <open-brack> Speaking in the Common Tongue (in this case , English) again <close-brack> You leave tonight <eos>
 <boname> JORAH <eoname> Very good <eos> We 'll prepare <eos>
 <open-exp> DAENERYS ' advisers start to leave <eos> DAARIO grins at DAENERYS who looks back at him <eos> BARRISTAN walks towards JORAH <close-exp>
 <boname> BARRISTAN <eoname> Ser Jorah <eos> You can use an extra sword <eos>
 <boname> JORAH <eoname> You 're the Queensguard , Ser Barristan <eos> Your place is by the Queen <eos> If we are truly her loyal servants , we 'll do whatever needs to be done <eos> No matter the cost , no matter our pride <eos>
 <open-exp> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Scene shifts to Beyond The Wall in the North <eos> SAMWELL TARLY , GILLY and her baby are walking south towards Castle Black <close-exp>
 <boname> SAMWELL <eoname> We 're west of Castle Black , but the Nightfort 's closest to us <eos> It was the first castle on the Wall <eos> The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I <eos> Too big , impossible to maintain <eos> Other than Castle Black itself , the Nightfort 's the perfect castle for us <eos> It 's got a secret sally port , the Black Gate , as old as the Wall itself <eos> No one 's used it for centuries , most likely <eos> It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort , if no one knows how to find it , which , it just so happens I do <eos>
 <open-exp> GILLY stops and looks at SAMWELL in a confused manner <close-exp>
 <boname> GILLY <eoname> How do you know all that <question>
 <boname> SAMWELL <eoname> I read about it in a very old book <eos>
 <boname> GILLY <eoname> You know all that from staring at marks on paper <question>
 <boname> SAMWELL <eoname> Yes <eos>
 <boname> GILLY <eoname> You 're like a wizard <eos>
 <open-exp> SAMWELL smiles <eos> Next shot , GILLY and SAMWELL gaze up at the Wall <close-exp>

 <open-exp> TALISA puts her hand on ROBB 'S shoulder , runs it down his arm , before grabbing his hand and placing it on her stomach <close-exp>

 <boname> TALISA <eoname> I don 't know <eos> But if it 's a boy , I know what we should name him <eos>

 <boname> WALDER <eoname> I 've given you meat and wine and music but I haven 't shown you the hospitality you deserve <eos> My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift <eos>

 <boname> SAM <eoname> What was she like <question>
 <boname> JON <eoname> She <eos> <eos> <eos>she had red hair <eos>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> Oh <question> How big were her feet <question>
 <boname> JON <eoname> Well what do you want me to say <question>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone <eos> To be with someone <eos> To love someone and have them love you back <eos> We 're all gonna die a lot sooner than I 'd planned <eos> You 're the closest I 'll ever get to know it <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> So you and Gilly never-
 <boname> SAM <eoname> No <eos> <eos> <eos>she just had a baby <exclamation> <eos> <eos> <eos>and she never offered <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> But if she had , you would 've <question> You 'd have broken your vows <question>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> The interesting thing is , our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> What <question>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> "I shall take no wife" yes , that 's in there , there 's no denying that <eos> "I shall father no children" it 's very specific <eos> But what our vows have to say about other <eos> <eos> <eos>activities <eos> <eos> <eos>is open to interpretation <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I don 't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation <eos>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> Anyway , there 's nothing for him to interpret <eos> We didn 't <eos> So what 's it like <question>
 <boname> JON <eoname> It 's <eos> <eos> <eos>there 's this person , this whole other person <eos> And you 're wrapped up in them and they 're wrapped up in you and <eos> <eos> <eos>you <eos> <eos> <eos>for a little <eos> <eos> <eos>for a little while you 're more than just you , you 're <eos> <eos> <eos>well I don 't know , I 'm not a bleedin ' poet <exclamation>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> No , you 're really not <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> And what did I get for it <question> An arrow six inches from my heart <eos>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> There 'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> There will <eos>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> They 've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> Go get some sleep , Sam <eos> I 'll take this watch <eos>

 <boname> TORMUND <eoname> Did I ever tell you about her <question> My Sheila <question>
 <boname> YGRITTE <eoname> Yes <eos>
 <boname> TORMUND <eoname> Oh that was a night to remember <eos> Of course , I 'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp , but she knew how to use them <eos> And she was nice and soft down below <eos> No , she was no ordinary beast <eos> <open-brack> <question> <close-brack>
 <boname> YGRITTE <eoname> I know you never fucked a bear <eos> You know you never fucked a bear <eos> Right now I don 't wanna think about the bear you never fucked <eos> Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow 's heart <eos>
 <boname> TORMUND <eoname> We could be waiting here a while <eos>
 <boname> YGRITTE <eoname> Good <eos> The longer we wait , the more arrows I 'll have <eos> When they came up here , to our land , and put up a big wall and said it was their 's <eos> Then they started hunting us down <eos> But this time , we 're the one 's doing the hunting <eos>
 <boname> STYR <eoname> You 've got a lot to say about killing <eos> Even more words than arrows <eos>
 <boname> YGRITTE <eoname> Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did <eos> More , I reckon <eos>
 <boname> STYR <eoname> Yes <eos> But none of those were your Crow lover <eos>
 <boname> YGRITTE <eoname> I probably killed him already <eos>
 <boname> STYR <eoname> So you 've said <eos>
 <boname> YGRITTE <eoname> And if not <eos> The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck <eos>
 <boname> STYR <eoname> And more words <eos> Know what I think you do when you see him <question> Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge <eos>
 <open-exp> Everyone laughs <eos> Ygritte gets up and rushes towards Styr <close-exp>
 <boname> YGRITTE <eoname> What , you been thinkin ' about that ginger minge <question> Wondering what it tastes like <question>

 <boname> SAM <eoname> Maester Aemon <eos> How did you know-
 <boname> AEMON <eoname> That it was you <question> Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night <question>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> Let me help you <eos>
 <boname> AEMON <eoname> Oh , no need <eos> I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black <eos> Thousands of books and no eyes to read them <eos> Old age is a wonderful source of irony if nothing else <eos> But you didn 't answer my question , what are you reading <question>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> Maester <open-brack> <question> <close-brack>
 <boname> AEMON <eoname> Ah , the Wildlings <eos> I can assure you that the closest Maester <open-brack> <question> <close-brack> ever got to a Wildling was this very library <eos>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> But what he says about what they do <eos> <eos> <eos>it 's all true <eos> It 's exactly what the survivors of <open-brack> <question> <close-brack> report <eos>
 <boname> AEMON <eoname> Yes <eos> Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us <exclamation> Love is the death of duty <eos> I told that to your friend Jon Snow once <eos> He didn 't listen and neither did you <eos> That 's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love <eos>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> I don 't love her <eos>
 <boname> AEMON <eoname> Yes you do <eos>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> No <eos>
 <boname> AEMON <eoname> Yes you do <exclamation> I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me <eos> I remember how it sounds <exclamation> I was in love once <eos>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> You were <question>
 <boname> AEMON <eoname> You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child , is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once , more or less , like you <question>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> I 'm sorry Maester , I didn 't mean it like that <eos>
 <boname> AEMON <eoname> You know who I was before I came here <question> What I could 've been if I 'd only said the word <question> Of course you do <eos> I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen <eos> A future king always does <eos> Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections <eos> One of them succeeded <eos> I was very young <eos>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> Who was she <question>
 <boname> AEMON <eoname> Ah ha <eos> I could tell you everything about her <eos> Who she was <eos> How we met <eos> The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose <eos> I can see her right in front of me <eos> She 's more real than you are <eos> We could spend all night trading tales of lost love <eos> Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death <eos> Go to bed Tarly <eos>

 <boname> ALLISER <eoname> A hundred thousand you say <question>
 <boname> JON <eoname> Yes sir <eos>
 <boname> ALLISER <eoname> You can say it if you like <eos> We should 've sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> It was a difficult decision either way , Ser <eos>
 <boname> ALLISER <eoname> Do you know what leadership means , Lord Snow <question> It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every little twat with a mouth <eos> But if he starts second-guessing himself , that 's the end <eos> For him <eos> For the clever little twats <eos> For everyone <eos> This is not the end <eos> Not for us <eos> Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back <eos> And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job <eos>
 <open-exp> Sam and Gilly are walking down a hall <eos> Sam unlocks a door and they both enter <eos> The room is filled with supplies <eos> Gilly lays her baby on a sack of something <close-exp>

 <boname> PYP <eoname> I 've never thrown a spear before <eos> I 've never held a sword with a proper edge <eos> There 's no place for me to be <eos> You 're not afraid <question>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> Of course I 'm afraid , there 's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us <eos>
 <boname> PYP <eoname> Well if you 're afraid of a band of Wildlings , how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker <question>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> I didn 't know I was going to kill it , but I had to do something I didn 't have any choice , he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby <eos> If someone had asked me my name right then , I wouldn 't have known <eos> I wasn 't Samwell Tarly anymore <eos> I wasn 't a Steward in the Night 's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that <eos> I was nothing at all <eos> And when you 're nothing at all , there 's no more reason to be afraid <eos>
 <boname> PYP <eoname> But you 're afraid now <question>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> Yes , well , I 'm not nothing anymore <eos>

 <boname> MANCE <eoname> We 're not in the seven kingdoms and you 're not dressed for this weather <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king <eos>
 <boname> MANCE <eoname> We do not kneel <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> I 'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall , I 'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them <eos> I 'm not here to slaughter beat dogs <eos> Their fate depends on their king <eos>
 <boname> MANCE <eoname> All the same , we do not kneel <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Take these men away <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> What are men of the Night 's Watch doing in a Wildling camp <question>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> You 're speaking to the one true king boy <eos> You 'll address him as your grace <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I know he 's the king <eos> My father died for him <eos> My name is Jon Snow , your grace <eos> I 'm Ned Stark 's son <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Your father was an honorable man <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> He was , your grace <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> What do you think he 'd have done with him <question>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I was this man 's prisoner once <eos> He could 've tortured me , he could 've killed me , but he spared my life <eos> I think my father would 've taken him prisoner , listened to what he had to say <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Very well <eos> *to Davos* Take him <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> Your grace <eos> If my father 'd seen the things that I 've seen , he 'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall <eos> All of them <eos>

 <open-exp> Qyburn is seen closely analyzing Gregor 's body <eos> He 's in Pycelle 's lab with Cersei <close-exp>
 <boname> PYCELLE <eoname> I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Bloody Martells <eos>
 <boname> PYCELLE <eoname> The cause appears to be manticore venom <eos>
 <boname> QYBURN <eoname> It is , yes , manticore <eos>
 <boname> PYCELLE <eoname> I 've read a good deal about it <eos> It 's a horrible poison , usually Mantari in origin <eos> Oh <exclamation> Yes , yes <eos> There 's nothing to be done <eos>
 <boname> QYBURN <eoname> Yes there is <eos>
 <boname> PYCELLE <eoname> May I ask what you think you 're doing <question>
 <boname> QYBURN <eoname> Saving him <eos>
 <boname> PYCELLE <eoname> Your grace <eos> I wish it were otherwise , but Sir Gregor is beyond saving <eos> Well , well beyond <eos> This man is not even a Maester , let alone Grand Maester <eos>
 <boname> QYBURN <eoname> That 's for the best <eos> No Maester knows how to save him <eos>
 <boname> PYCELLE <eoname> That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel , your grace <eos> His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural <eos> Rightly so in my opinion <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> You 're dismissed , Grand Maester <eos>
 <boname> PYCELLE <eoname> Your grace <eos> This is my laboratory <exclamation>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Not anymore <eos>
 <open-exp> Pycelle leaves the laboratory angrily as Qyburn tries to save Gregor 's body <close-exp>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> You can save him <question>
 <boname> QYBURN <eoname> Difficult to say , your grace , but if my past work is any guide <eos> We stand a chance <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Do everything you can <eos> Come to me with anything you need <eos>
 <boname> QYBURN <eoname> Thank you , your grace <eos> You should know , the process may change him , somewhat <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Will it weaken him <question>
 <boname> QYBURN <eoname> Oh no <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Very well then <eos>
 <open-exp> Cersei leaves as Qyburn drains Gregor 's blood <eos> Cersei is seen arguing with Tywin <close-exp>
 <boname> TYWIN <eoname> Not another word <eos> We 've been over this , the matter 's closed <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I 'm opening it again <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN <eoname> You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell <eos> Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I will not <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN <eoname> Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands <eos> Tyrion 's sentence will be carried out tomorrow <eos> You have , on several occasions , made great claims about your commitment to this family 's future <eos> Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I don 't care <eos> I will stay in King 's Landing where I belong with my son , the king <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN <eoname> When you were nine years old , I was called to the capital <eos> I decided to take your brother with me and not you <eos> You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I 'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won <eos> This isn 't going to be one of those times <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN <eoname> Do you think you 'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> When you marched into the throne room to tell me we 'd won the Battle at Blackwater , do you remember <question> <exclamation> I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen <eos> I was about to give him essence of nightshade , that 's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away <eos> Someone awful is coming to take him away <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN <eoname> No <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Joffrey is dead <eos> Myrcella 's been sold like livestock <eos> And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy , my last boy <eos> Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart <eos> I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN <eoname> And how will you do that <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I 'll tell everyone the truth <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN <eoname> And what truth would that be <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> You don 't know , do you <question> You never believed it <eos> How is that possible <question> What am I saying , of course it 's possible <eos> How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing <question> We were right there in front of you and you didn 't see us <eos> One look in the past twenty years , one real look and you would 've known <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN <eoname> Known what <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Everything they say is true about Jaime and me <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN <eoname> No , no , no , no , no <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Your legacy is a lie <eos>
 <boname> TYWIN <eoname> I don 't believe you <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Yes you do <eos>
 <open-exp> Cersei walks away , leaving Tywin standing there alone <eos> Jaime is turning pages in a book in another room <close-exp>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Jaime <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> You won <eos> One fewer brother <eos> Must be proud of yourself <eos> There 's really nothing you wouldn 't do , is there <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> For my family , no <eos> I would do things for my family you couldn 't imagine <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Tyrion is your family <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> He 's not <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> You don 't get to choose <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I do , so do you <eos> You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Are you really mad enough to blame him for that <question> He didn 't decide to kill her <eos> He was an infant <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> A disease doesn 't decide to kill you , all the same you cut it out before it does <eos> What do you decide <question> What do you choose <question>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> The things I did to get back to you , to endure all that , only to find you-
 <open-exp> Cersei kisses Jaime <close-exp>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I choose you <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Those are words <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Yes <eos> Like the ones I just said to father <eos> I told him <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Told him what <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I told him about us <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> You told him <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I told him I wouldn 't marry Loras Tyrell <eos> I told him I 'm staying right here with Tommen , with you <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> You think he 'll just accept that <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Go and ask him <eos>
 <open-exp> Cersei kisses Jaime <close-exp>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> What did you say <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I don 't want to talk about Tywin Lannister <eos> I don 't choose Tywin Lannister , I don 't love Tywin Lannister <eos> I love my brother <eos> I love my lover <eos> People will whisper , they 'll make their jokes <eos> Let them <eos> They 're all so small I can 't even see them <eos> I only see what matters <eos>

 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them <eos>
 <boname> FENNESZ <eoname> I do not mean to offend , your grace <eos> I went to one of these places <eos> The young prey on the old <eos> Take what they want and beat us if we resist <eos>

 <boname> FENNESZ <eoname> Your grace , I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> You want to return to a man who owned you , like a goat or a chair <question>
 <boname> FENNESZ <eoname> Please , your grace , the young may rejoice in the new world you 've built for them <eos> But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor <eos> I am not alone <eos> There are many outside waiting to beg the same-
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy <eos> I took it to bring people freedom <eos> But freedom means making your own choices <eos> I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master <eos> It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year <eos>

 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Why <question>
 <boname> DAARIO <eoname> I was a bad child <eos> I wasn 't big , but I was quick <eos> And I loved to fight <eos> So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits <eos> I had my first match when I was 16 <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> You were sold into slavery , forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters , and you 're defending the fighting pits <question>

 <boname> DAARIO <eoname> The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information <eos>
 <boname> BARRISTAN <eoname> How do you know that <question>
 <boname> DAARIO <eoname> Because I questioned him <eos>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> And the information you did get , he is young and poor <eos>
 <boname> MOSSADOR <eoname> He is born free <eos>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> Why should he want to bring back slavery <question> What did it do for him <question>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was <eos>
 <boname> MOSSADOR <eoname> They pay him <eos> Great families afraid to do a thing <eos> They pay poor man to do it for them <eos>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> And how do you know this <question>
 <boname> MOSSADOR <eoname> Everyone knows this <eos>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> I don 't know it , and I 'm the head of a great family <eos>
 <boname> BARRISTAN <eoname> We do not know what this man did or didn 't do <eos> (to Daenerys) Give him a trial , at least <eos> A fair trial <eos> Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose <eos> Teach them a better way <eos>
 <boname> MOSSADOR <eoname> I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes <eos> Things maybe are different there , I hope <eos> But here , in Meereen , before Daenerys Stormborn , they own us <eos> So we learn much about them or we do not live long <eos> They teach me what they are <eos> Mercy , fair trial these mean nothing to them <eos> All they understand is blood <exclamation>

 <boname> BARRISTAN <eoname> Your Grace , I served in his Kingsguard <eos> I was at his side from the first <eos> Your enemies did not lie <eos>

 <boname> BARRISTAN <eoname> When the people rose in revolt against him , your father set their towns and castles aflame <eos> He murdered sons in front of their fathers <eos> He burned men alive with Wildfire , and laughed as they screamed <eos> And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> I 'm not my father <eos>
 <boname> BARRISTAN <eoname> No , Your Grace <eos> Thank the gods <eos> But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved <eos> And each time it made him feel powerful and right <eos> Until the very end <eos>

 <boname> GILLY <eoname> My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside <eos> None of us were allowed to go near them <eos> But we heard them <eos> Especially at night <eos> They started to sound <eos> <eos> <eos> not like themselves <eos>

 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> Her name 's Gilly <eos> She 's nice <eos> I 'm teaching her to read <eos>
 <boname> SELYSE <eoname> She 's a wildling <eos> Your father defeated their people <eos> He executed her king for treason <eos> They could strike at him by striking at you <eos>
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> Gilly wouldn 't do that <eos>

 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake <eos> You prevented that order from being carried out <eos> You showed mercy to Mance Rayder <eos> A king 's word is law <eos> Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers <eos> Show too much kindness , people won 't fear you <eos> If people don 't fear you , they don 't follow you <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> With respect , Your Grace , the free folk will never follow you , no matter what you do <eos> You 're the man who burned their king alive <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Who then <question> You <question>
 <boname> JON <eoname> No <eos> Only one of their own <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont <question>
 <boname> JON <eoname> The Lord Commander 's niece <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Lady of Bear Island , and a child of 10 <eos> I asked her to commit her house to my cause , that 's her response <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> "Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North , whose name is Stark <eos>" (Jon smiles)
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> That amuses you <question>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I apologize , Your Grace <eos> Northerners can be a bit like the free folk <eos> Loyal to their own <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> I know <eos> My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father 's help <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> Tonight , the Night 's Watch elect a new Lord Commander <eos> Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> Most likely <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> Unpleasant man <eos> He thinks you 're a traitor <eos> What 's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command <question>
 <boname> JON <eoname> Unpleasant , I expect <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Your bravery made him look weak <eos> He 'll punish you for it <eos> I don 't punish men for bravery <eos> I reward them <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I don 't doubt it , Your Grace <eos> But I 'm a brother of the Night 's Watch <eos> I 've pledged them my life , my honor , my sword <eos> I don 't know what I have left to give you <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> You can give me the North <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I can 't <eos> Even if I wanted to , I 'm a bastard <eos> A Snow <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Kneel before me <eos> Lay your sword at my feet <eos> Pledge me your service and you 'll rise again as Jon Stark , Lord of Winterfell <eos>

 <boname> JON <eoname> It 's the first thing I ever remember wanting <eos> I 'd daydream that my father would ask the king , and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again <eos>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> You deserve this <eos> You do <eos> I couldn 't be happier for you <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I 'm going to refuse him <eos>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> But you 'd be Lord of Winterfell <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I swore a vow to the Night 's Watch <eos> If I don 't take my own word seriously , what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be <question>

 <boname> AEMON <eoname> Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch <question>
 <open-exp> Janos Slynt stands up <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JANOS <eoname> Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight , he 's a man of true nobility <eos> He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack , and led us to victory against the wildlings <eos>
 <boname> MEN <eoname> Hear , hear <eos>
 <boname> JANOS <eoname> He 's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life <eos> He 's the only true choice <eos>
 <open-exp> Alliser smiles <eos> Men cheer and beat on the tables <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> AEMON <eoname> Is there anyone else <question>
 <boname> SHADOW_TOWER_BROTHER <eoname> Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger <eos> Through 10 winters he served <eos> As commander of the Shadow Tower , he kept the wildlings away <eos> We could do no better <eos>
 <open-exp> Men , including Jon , bang their cups on the table , but the reaction is much weaker <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> AEMON <eoname> If there 's no one else , we will begin the voting <eos> The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne <eos> The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister <eos> Each brother will--

 <boname> SAM <eoname> Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children , Jon Snow was leading <eos>
 <open-exp> The men go quiet <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> Ser Alliser fought bravely , it is true <eos> And when he was wounded , it is Jon who saved us <eos> He took charge of the wall 's defense <eos> He killed the Magnar of the Thenns <eos> (a man next to Sam nods) He went North to deal with Mance Rayder , knowing it almost certainly meant his own death <eos> Before that , he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont <eos> Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward <eos> He saw something in Jon , and now we 've all seen it , too <eos> He may be young , but he 's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest <eos>
 <open-exp> The men give Jon a strong cheer <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ALLISER <eoname> I can 't argue with any of that <eos> (stands up) But who does Jon Snow want to command <question> Night 's Watch or the wildlings <question> Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times <eos> What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis 's army hadn 't come along <question> We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery <eos> Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life , or a man who makes love to them <question>
 <open-exp> Jon doesn 't respond <eos> Maester Aemon rises again <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> AEMON <eoname> It is time <eos>
 <open-exp> Brothers of the Night 's Watch walk to the front of the room , placing their tokens into a jar <eos> A brother breaks the jar and counts the tokens <eos> Alliser and Jon have the same amount of tokens <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BROTHER <eoname> It appears to be a tie , Maester <eos>
 <open-exp> Maester Aemon rises once more , feels each stack of tokens to determine which is which , and casts his own vote for Jon <eos> The men near Alliser look angry <eos> The men grouped around Mallister are content <eos> Everyone else cheers <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> MARGAERY <eoname> I absolutely adore him <eos> You raised a gallant young man <eos> I 'm forever grateful <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Good <eos> Good <eos> I 'm glad to hear you 're happy <eos>
 <boname> MARGAERY <eoname> Ecstatic <eos> I really am <eos> Exhausted , to be honest , but what can I expect , he is half lion , half stag <eos> (Margaery 's friends laugh) <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I 'll leave you to it then <eos> (Turns to leave) <eos>
 <boname> MARGAERY <eoname> Oh , forgive me , I haven 't been at Court for long , I get so confused <eos> What 's the proper way to address you now <question> Queen Mother or Dowager Queen <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> There 's no need for such formalities <eos>
 <boname> MARGAERY <eoname> In any event , judging from the King 's enthusiasm , the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Won 't that be a lovely day <eos>
 <boname> MARGAERY <eoname> Can you imagine the celebrations <question> They 'll ring the bells all day and night <eos>

 <open-exp> A horse whinnies <eos> Bolton bannermen ride to the keep <eos> In the keep , a number of workmen are busy building and repairing things <eos> Some men carry some raven cages through the middle of the courtyard <eos> Theon , carrying a dead bird , walks through for a moment <eos> He then comes across some soldiers lifting up some flayed bodies with rope <eos> He becomes very tense and forces himself to keep walking , head down <eos> A raven picks at a body in a cart <eos> <close-exp>

 <open-exp> Roose and Ramsay sit at a table as Theon cuts some food <eos> Ramsay talks with his face stuffed <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROOSE <eoname> We can 't hold the North with terror alone <eos>
 <boname> RAMSAY <eoname> You can 't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us <eos>
 <boname> ROOSE <eoname> I sent you there to collect taxes , not bodies <eos>
 <boname> RAMSAY <eoname> Lord Cerwyn refused to pay <eos> Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark , and he 'd be damned if he kissed a traitor 's boot <eos>
 <open-exp> Theon holds the food in front of Ramsay <eos> He takes some of it and puts it on his plate <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROOSE <eoname> He left you no choice <eos>
 <boname> RAMSAY <eoname> I flayed him living , along with his wife and brother <eos> Made his son watch <eos>
 <boname> ROOSE <eoname> And <question>
 <boname> RAMSAY <eoname> The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes <eos>
 <boname> ROOSE <eoname> (After a moment) <eos> I have something important to tell you <eos> Stop eating and listen <eos>
 <open-exp> Ramsay , who had been heavily engrossed in his eating , stops suddenly and looks up <eos> Theon slowly puts down a plate nearby <eos> Ramsay puts down his silverware and sits back , looking at his father <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ROOSE <eoname> We don 't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us <eos> Do you understand that <question>
 <boname> RAMSAY <eoname> Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
 <boname> ROOSE <eoname> I had a pact with Tywin Lannister , and Tywin Lannister is dead <eos> The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact <eos> They 've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north <eos> If you think they will for us , you 're a fool <eos> We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses , and parleying those alliances into greater power <eos> The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn 't by peeling a man 's skin off <eos> The best way is marriage <eos> (Stands up) <eos> Now that you 're a Bolton by royal decree , it 's time you married a suitable bride <eos> And as it happens , I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North <eos>

 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> Home <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> The Boltons have Winterfell <eos> (He nods) <eos> The marriage proposal , it wasn 't for you <question>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> (Shakes his head) <eos> No <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> Roose Bolton murdered my brother <eos> He betrayed my family <exclamation>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> He did <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> He serves the Lannisters <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> For now <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> I won 't go <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> Winterfell is your home <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> Not anymore <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> Always <eos> You 're a Stark <eos> Dyeing your hair doesn 't change that <eos> You 're Sansa Stark <eos> The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark <eos> Your place is in the North <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> I can 't marry him <eos> You can 't make me <eos> He 's a traitor <eos> A murderer <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> You 're not marrying Roose Bolton <eos> No , you 'll be marrying his son and heir , Ramsay <eos> One day he 'll be Warden of the North and you will -
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> No <exclamation>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> Sansa -
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> No , you can 't make me <eos> I will starve myself <eos> I will die before I have to go there <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> (Grabbing her) <eos> I won 't force you to do anything <eos> Don 't you know by now how much I care for you <question> Say the word and we turn the horses round , but listen to me <eos> Listen <eos> (Quietly) <eos> You 've been running all your life <eos> Terrible things happened to your family and you weep <eos> You sit alone in a darkened room , mourning their fates <eos> You 've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father <eos> Stop being a bystander , do you hear me <question> Stop running <eos> There 's no justice in the world <eos> Not unless we make it <eos> You loved your family <eos> Avenge them <eos>
 <open-exp> He kisses her forehead <eos> He walks back to their horses <eos> After a few moments , she regains her composure and gets on her horse <eos> The party starts moving again <eos> On top of a large hill nearby , Brienne and Podrick watch as the party arrives at the keep <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> How do we get through there <question>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> We don 't <eos> We go around <eos> (She turns her horse and begins leaving) <eos>

 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> He hates that nickname <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> Well , he 's not here to complain about it , is he <question>
 <open-exp> Podrick finishes scrubbing and hands the boot to Brienne <eos> He puts the brush down <eos> Brienne begins putting the boot on <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings <eos> One night , he had a bit too much to drink <eos> And he was famished , so he borrowed a ham <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> He borrowed it <question>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> He wasn 't a thief <eos> He was drunk and hungry and he wasn 't thinking <eos> I was drunk too <eos> He gave me half the ham <eos> Next morning , one of the guards saw him passed out , under a wagon , with the ham bone still in his hand <eos> They hanged the man afternoon <eos> They tied the noose for me too , but , Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne <eos> So he pardoned me , and sent me to King 's Landing to squire for his son <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> As punishment <eos> For both of you <eos>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> It didn 't seem that way <eos> Lord Tyrion was always very good to me <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> (Walks away to get firewood) <eos> Yes , all of your lords were very kind to you <eos> All except me <eos> Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person <eos>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> I 'm not sorry <eos> You 're the best fighter I 've ever seen <eos> You beat The Hound <eos> I 'm proud to be your squire <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> I 'm sorry I 'm always snapping at you <eos>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> If you wouldn 't snap at me I wouldn 't learn anything <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> You want to be a knight , Pod <question>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> Yes <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> Starting tomorrow , we 'll train with the sword twice a day , before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening <eos> (Sits down) <eos> And I 'm going to show you how to ride properly <eos>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> Thank you <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> I can 't knight you , but I can teach you how to fight <eos>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> I suppose that 's more important <eos>
 <open-exp> Podrick leans over the campfire with some rocks <eos> He strikes them together until he gets a spark , and blows until the fire starts going <eos> He wipes himself off and stands up , walking over to Brienne <eos> He begins taking her armor off <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> You weren 't a knight , but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon , weren 't you <question>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> I was <eos>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> Lord Tyrion said he was a good man <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> He was <eos>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> But how did you end up serving Renly <question>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> (After a few moments) <eos> When I was a girl , my father held a ball <eos> I 'm his only living child , so he wants to make a good match for me <eos> He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth <eos> I didn 't want to go , but he dragged me to the ballroom <eos> (Pauses) <eos> And it was wonderful <eos> None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was <eos> The shoved each other , and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance <eos> And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles <eos> (Smiles) <eos> My father smiled at me and I smiled at him <eos> I 'd never been so happy <eos> (Her smile drops) <eos> Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering <eos> And then they all started to laugh , they couldn 't keep the game going any longer <eos> They were toying with me <eos> ‘Brienne the Beauty ' , they called me <eos> Great joke <eos> And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive <eos> A great lumbering beast <eos> I tried to run away , but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms <eos> <boquote>Don 't let them see your tears , <eoquote> he told me <eos> <boquote>They 're nasty little shits <eos> The nasty little shits aren 't worth crying over <eos><eoquote> He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word <eos> And he was the king 's brother after all <eos>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> But wasn 't he <eos> <eos> <eos> Lord Tyrion said he was <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> Yes , Pod , he liked men , I 'm not an idiot <eos> He didn 't love me , he didn 't want me , he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn 't see me hurt <eos> He saved me from being a joke <eos> From that day until his last day <eos> And I couldn 't save him in return <eos> Nothing 's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love <eos> One day , I will avenge King Renly <eos>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> But you said a shadow murdered him <eos> How do you fight a shadow <question>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon <eos> I know it was Stannis <eos> I know it in my heart <eos> Stannis is a man , not a shadow <eos> And a man can be killed <eos>

 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> (To Olly as he closes the door) <eos> I 'd like to speak alone <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> Olly is my steward now , as I was Lord Commander Mormont 's <eos> I want him to attend my meetings , to learn from men with experience <eos> One day , he might command <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Very well <eos> (They all sit down) <eos> Have you considered my offer <question>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I have <eos> And I thank you for it <eos> You do me great honor <eos> All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Say the word and you will be <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> But I have to refuse you <eos> I 'm Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch <eos> My place is here <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> I 'm giving you a chance to avenge your family <eos> To take back the castle where you grew up <eos> To rule the North <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I wish I could fight beside you <eos> Believe me , I do <eos> But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood <eos> I pledged my life to the Night 's Watch <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> You 're as stubborn as your father <eos> And as honorable <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I can imagine no higher praise <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> I didn 't mean it as praise <eos> Honor got your father killed <eos> (Stands up) <eos> But if your mind 's made up , I won 't try to persuade you <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> May I ask , Your Grace , how long you plan to stay at Castle Black <question>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Are you bored of us already <question>
 <boname> JON <eoname> You saved us from Mance Rayder 's army <eos> We will never forget that <eos> But it 's a question of survival <eos> The Night 's Watch can 't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely <eos> Winter is coming <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> I know it <eos> We march on Winterfell within the fortnight <eos> Before the snows trap us here <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> And the wildlings <question>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> They 'd rather burn than fight for me , so be it <eos> I leave their fate to you <eos> You could execute them , that 's the safest course <eos> (After a moment) <eos> Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was <eos> I assume the brothers of the Night 's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> Most of the brothers , yes <eos> There 's little love for the free folk here <eos> (Olly stares at him) <eos>

 <boname> JON <eoname> As long as he 's ruling them <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> He 's the one true king <eos> He has the blood right to that throne <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I 've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> Have you now <question> (Turning to Olly) <eos> How does the Night 's Watch vow go again <question> I bet you 've got it memorized since you got here <eos>
 <open-exp> Olly looks to Jon <eos> Jon looks at him , crosses his arms , and nods <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> OLLY <eoname> Night gathers and now my watch begins -
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> Not that bit , the bit at the end <eos>
 <boname> OLLY <eoname> I 'm the sword in the darkness , the watcher on the walls , the shield that guards the realm of men <eos> I pledge my life -
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> Wait , that 's enough <eos> <boquote>The shield that guards the realm of men <eos><eoquote> That 's what you swore to be <eos> Now I 'm not a learned man , but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world <eos> It just might mean wading in the muck , getting your boots dirty , and doing what needs to be doing <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> And what needs to be done <question>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> As long as the Boltons rule the North , (Stands up) , the North will suffer <eos> Just one man 's opinion <eos>

 <boname> HIGH_SEPTON <eoname> As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world <eos> An insult to me is an insult to the Gods <eos> An assault on my person , is an assault on our very religion <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> You were assaulted <question>
 <boname> HIGH_SEPTON <eoname> I was , by those fanatics who call themselves ‘sparrows ' <eos> They humiliated me , they they beat me , they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones <eos> I am lucky to be alive <eos>
 <boname> QYBURN <eoname> I heard this all began in Littlefinger 's brothel <eos>
 <boname> MACE <eoname> High Septon , this is a rather shocking thing to hear <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SEPTON <eoname> I tend to both the highest born , and the lowliest amongst us <eos> Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother <eos>

 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here <eos> Where is he <question>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> High Sparrow <question> Sounds ridiculous , doesn 't it <question> Like Lord Duckling , or King Turtle <eos> (Laughs) <eos> So , it 's meant to <eos> We 're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us <eos> (Prepares soup for the next person in line) <eos> The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn 't sit well with some , so they belittle me <eos>

 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> Seven blessings to you , my dear <eos> It 's only a name , quite an easy burden to wear <eos> Far easier than hers <eos> (Prepares soup for the next person in line) <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Why no shoes <question>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more <eos> We all do that <eos> It stops us from forgetting what we really are <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Is that why you came to King 's Landing <question> To remind everyone <question>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> Everyone <question> I have a hard enough job reminding myself <eos> Oh , I tell them no one 's special <eos> And they think I 'm special for telling them so <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> (Smiles) <eos> Perhaps they 're right <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> It would be comforting to believe that , wouldn 't it <question> The Gods sent you here to tempt me <question> I hope not <eos> I had assumed you 'd only come here to arrest me <eos> For that incident with the High Septon <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world , wouldn 't you say <question>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> Hypocrisy is a boil <eos> Lancing a is never pleasant <eos> Although , they could have been more careful with the blade <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> The High Septon came to speak to me today <eos> He doesn 't want me to arrest you , he wants me to execute you <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> I wouldn 't presume to know your thoughts on the matter <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> (After a moment) <eos> My thoughts on the matter align with your own <eos> The High Septon 's behaviour was corrosive , as was his attitude <eos> Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside <eos> So now he resides in the Red Keep 's dungeons instead <eos> (The High Sparrow looks up at her surprised) <eos> The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world <eos> If one collapses , so does the other <eos> We must do everything necessary to protect one another <eos>

 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> (They begin walking) <eos> I assure you she 's still a virgin <eos> Tyrion never consummated the marriage <eos> By the law of the land , she 's no man 's wife <eos> Inspect her , if you must <eos>
 <boname> ROOSE <eoname> I leave that to the brothel keeper <eos> It 's her name I need , not her virtue <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> Then I have delivered everything I 've promised <eos>
 <boname> ROOSE <eoname> And you prepared for the consequences <eos> When the Lannisters hear I 've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> The Lannister name doesn 't mean what it once did <eos> Tywin is dead <eos> He kept his house in power through sheer will <eos> Without him , Jaime has one hand and no allies , Tommen is a soft boy , not a king to fear <eos>

 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> Every ambitious move is a gamble <eos> You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark 's heart <eos> It appears that your gamble paid off <eos> You 're Warden of the North <eos>

 <boname> JAIME <eoname> It has to be me <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> (Gets up starts walking) <eos> If I 'm putting something of a lit together , a one-handed man , (Grabs some rope and walks back) , who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros , is not -

 <boname> BRONN <eoname> (Sheaths his sword) <eos> You set your brother free , didn 't you <question> I bet your sister didn 't like that <eos>

 <open-exp> Cersei sits in her chair , looking angry <eos> At the table is Maester Pycelle , Qyburn , Mace Tyrell , and an empty chair <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MACE <eoname> The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crown 's debts <eos> Given the expense of rebuilding the royal -
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> How much can the Crown afford <question>
 <boname> MACE <eoname> With winter coming , half what they ask <eos> Less <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> You 're the Master of Coin <eos> How do we pay them <question>
 <boname> MACE <eoname> Well , House Tyrell could front the gold , and the the Crown will pay us back in time , or I 'll have words with my daughter <eos>
 <open-exp> Mace smiles , as if expecting a laugh <eos> Qyburn and Pycelle both look down <eos> Mace 's smile fades <eos> Cersei smiles <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> You 've already given us too much <eos> (Gets up and walks to a window) <eos> No , we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank <eos>
 <boname> MACE <eoname> Absolutely <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> In person <eos>
 <boname> MACE <eoname> (After a moment , looks at her surprised) <eos> Me <question> (Qyburn smiles) <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank , someone of importance , to show these bankers our respect <eos> As the King 's Master of Coin , I can think of no one more qualified <eos>
 <boname> MACE <eoname> I will be honored , Your Grace <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law 's safety on this voyage <eos> (Smiling) <eos> He 's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort <eos>
 <open-exp> Ser Meryn walks into the room <eos> Mace turns to look at him , and then back at Cersei <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MACE <eoname> My very own Kingsguard <question> Please express -
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Safe travels , Lord Tyrell <eos>
 <boname> MACE <eoname> (Raises his hands) <eos> Of course , of course , (Gathers his belongings , and then gets up) <eos> I 'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos <eos>

 <open-exp> INT <eos> HIGH SPARROW 'S CHAMBER <close-exp>
 <open-exp> A note lies on the desk , stamped with the seal of the High Sparrow <eos> The High Sparrow sits behind his desk , across from Cersei <eos> She pours a glass of wine <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> May I offer you some wine , Your Holiness <question>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> No <eos> (Smiles) <eos>
 <open-exp> Cersei looks unsure , presumably having expected him to say yes <eos> After a moment she smiles and pushes the wine away <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> The old High Septon would have asked the vintage <eos> (Smiles) <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure <eos> But the truth is , (Chuckles) , I don 't like the taste <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Hmm <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> (After a moment) <eos> How may I serve <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned <eos> Silent sisters raped <eos> Bodies of holy men piled in the streets <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> Wars teach people to obey the sword , not the Gods <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own <eos> (HS raises an eyebrow) <eos> In the days before the Targaryens , the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> Well , the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> If I explain the holy purpose to my son , the king , I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> An army and service to the Gods themselves <eos> And to you , of course <eos> As the chosen representative of the Seven <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> An honor I never expected <eos> Or indeed , ever wished for <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Which is why you were chosen <eos> (HS smiles) <eos> You and I both know how the world works <eos> Too often the wicked are the wealthiest , beyond the reach of justice <eos> The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> All sinners are equal before the Gods <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> (Smiles <eos> Continues after a moment) <eos> What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst <question> Shielded by gold and privilege <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> May the Father judge him justly <eos> (Smiles) <eos>

 <boname> JON <eoname> (To some of the men sparring) <eos> Good <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch <eos>
 <boname> SELYSE <eoname> A bastard by some tavern slut <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Perhaps , but that wasn 't Ned Stark 's way <eos>
 <boname> SELYSE <eoname> I should have given you a son <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Not your fault <eos>
 <boname> SELYSE <eoname> Whose then <question> (Looks at their daughter Shireen) <eos> I gave you nothing but weakness <eos> (Turns back) <eos> And deformity <eos> (Stannis shakes his head) <eos>
 <boname> MELISANDRE <eoname> (Walking towards them) <eos> Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light <eos>
 <boname> SELYSE <eoname> My Lady <eos>
 <boname> MELISANDRE <eoname> Her father is the Lord 's chosen King <eos> And her father 's blood runs through her veins <eos>

 <open-exp> INT <eos> JON 'S CHAMBER <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Jon sits at his desk <eos> Sam hands him various letters to sign , one by one <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> Lord Ashford <eos> (Jon signs) <eos> Lady Coalfield <eos> (Jon signs) <eos> Lord Smallwood <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> Never even heard of these people <eos>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> They haven 't heard of you either <eos> (Jon signs) <eos> But we need men and they have some <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> And how many men does this Lord Maison have to send us <question>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> (Chuckles , looking at the next letter) <eos> More than Lord Weebly <eos>
 <open-exp> Sam 's face grows dark after reading the next letter <eos> When Jon finishes signing the letter to Lord Weebly , Sam hands it to him , saying nothing <eos> Jon begins signing , but hesitates <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JON <eoname> Not him <eos>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> I know , I 'm sorry , but we need men and supplies <eos> And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> He murdered my brother <eos>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall <eos> We can 't watch the Wall with 50 men <eos> And we can 't get more men without help from the Warden of the North <eos>
 <open-exp> Jon hesitates another moment , and then relents and signs the letter <eos> He leans his chair back , and Sam gathers up all of the signed letters <eos> He walks away , almost bumping into Melisandre as she enters Jon 's chambers <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SAM <eoname> Apologies , my Lady <eos>
 <open-exp> Sam and Melisandre both look at Jon <eos> Jon nods at Sam , and he leaves <eos> Melisandre closes the door behind him , and Jon straightens up his posture <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MELISANDRE <eoname> Lord Commander <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> How can I help you <question>
 <boname> MELISANDRE <eoname> Come with us when we ride south <eos> (Walks forwards) <eos> None of us know the castle as well as you do <eos> Its hidden tunnels , its weaknesses , its people <eos> Winterfell was your home once <eos> Don 't you want to chase the rats out of it <question> (Turns to Jon) <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> Castle Black is my home now <eos> Night 's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms <eos>
 <boname> MELISANDRE <eoname> There 's only one war <eos> Life against death <eos> Come <eos> Let me show what you 're fighting for <eos> (Walks in front of Jon) <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> You 're gonna show me some vision in the fire <eos> Forgive me , my Lady <eos> But I don 't trust in visions <eos>
 <boname> MELISANDRE <eoname> No visions <eos> No magic <eos> Just life <eos>
 <open-exp> She opens up her robes , naked underneath <eos> She leans back , and takes Jon 's hand , slowly leading it up her body to cup her breast <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MELISANDRE <eoname> Do you feel my heart beating <question> This power in you , you resist it , and that 's your mistake <eos> Embrace it <eos>
 <open-exp> Melisandre smiles and looks down at Jon 's hand <eos> Jon looks too <eos> Realizing that she is no longer holding it there , he quickly pulls it away <eos> Melisandre caresses Jon 's face and sits on his lap <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MELISANDRE <eoname> The Lord of Light made us male and female <eos> Two parts of a greater whole <eos> We are joining this power <eos> Power to make life , power to make light , and power to cast shadows <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I don 't think Stannis would like that very much <eos>
 <boname> MELISANDRE <eoname> Then we shouldn 't tell him <eos> (Starts unbuttoning Jon 's coat) <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I can 't <eos>
 <boname> MELISANDRE <eoname> Why <question>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I swore a vow <eos> (Melisandre looks at him incredulously) <eos> I loved another <eos>
 <boname> MELISANDRE <eoname> The dead don 't need lovers <eos> Only the living <eos>
 <open-exp> Jon keeps her from unbuttoning his coat any further , breathing heavily <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I know <eos> But I still love her <eos>
 <open-exp> Melisandre stands up , closes her robes , and walks away <eos> After opening the door to leave , she turns to Jon <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Are you lonely <question>
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> (Turns around , holding something) <eos> Just bored <eos>

 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> I know Castle Black is no place for a child , but I -
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> I like it <eos> (Walks to a table) <eos> I thought I 'd be left at home <eos> I know mother didn 't want to bring me <eos> (Picks up an X from the table) <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Why do you say that <question>
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> She told me , "I don 't want to bring you <eos>"
 <open-exp> Shireen fiddles with the objects in her hands <eos> Stannis looks down <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> She shouldn 't have said that <eos>
 <open-exp> Shireen puts down the objects she was playing with , and turns to leave <eos> Before opening the door , she turns back to Stannis <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> Are you ashamed of me , father <question>
 <open-exp> Stannis looks up surprised <eos> He puts down what he was doing <eos> Shireen looks down <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> When you were an infant , (Stands up and walks around his desk) , the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone <eos> His goods were junk except for one wooden doll <eos> He 'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House <eos> No doubt he 'd heard of your birth , and assumed new fathers were easy targets <eos> I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle , (Shireen smiles) , and you pressed it to your cheek <eos> (Looks down <eos> Shireen 's smile drops) <eos> By the time we burnt the doll , it was too late <eos> (Walks to the table and adjusts the objects on it) <eos> I was told you would die <eos> Or worse , the grayscale would go slow <eos> (Turns to her) <eos> Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you <eos> Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men , before the sickness spread to the castle <eos> I told them all to go to hell <eos> (Shireen smiles) <eos> I called in every maester on this side of the world <eos> Every healer , every apothecary <eos> They stopped the disease and saved your life <eos> Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men <eos> (Walks towards her) <eos> You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon <eos> And you are my daughter <eos>

 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> I thought I might find you here <eos> (Sansa turns to him) <eos> Your Aunt Lyanna <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> Father never talked about her <eos> Sometimes I 'd find him down here , lighting the candles <eos> They say she was beautiful <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> I saw her once <eos> I was a boy , living with your mother 's family <eos> Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal <eos> Everyone was there <eos> The Mad King , your father , Robert Baratheon <eos> And Lyanna , she was already promised to Robert <eos> You can imagine what it was like for me , a boy from nowhere , with nothing to his name , watching these legendary men , tilting at the lists <eos> The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen <eos> When Rhaegar won , everyone cheered for the prince <eos> I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair <eos> How handsome he was <eos> Until he rode right past his wife , Elia Martell , and all the smiles died <eos> I 've never seen so many people so quiet <eos> He rode past his wife , and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna 's lap <eos> Blue as frost <eos> How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt <question>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> Yes , he chose her<ellipsis> and then he kidnapped her and raped her <eos>

 <boname> SANSA <eoname> You can 't leave me here <exclamation>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> I know how hard it is to live with people you despise , believe me <eos> But it won 't be for long <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> How do you know <question>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> (They begin walking again) <eos> Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black <eos> He 'll march south to King 's Landing before the winter snows block his way <eos> But first , he has to take Winterfell <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> You don 't know that <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> I do <eos> Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he 'll rally your father 's bannermen to his cause <eos> With the North behind him , Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> You think he 'll defeat the Boltons <question>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> He has a larger army <eos> He 's the finest military commander in Westeros <eos> A betting man would put his money on Stannis <eos> (They stop) <eos> As it happens , I am a betting man <eos>

 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> Stannis takes Winterfell , he rescues you from the most despised family in the North <eos> Grateful for your late father 's courageous support for his claim , he names you Wardeness of the North <eos>

 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> Then you will take this Bolton boy , Ramsay , and make him yours <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> I don 't know how to do that <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> Of course you do <eos> He 's already fallen for you <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> His father frightens me <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> He should , he 's a dangerous man <eos> But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered <eos> And you 've learnt to maneuver from the very best <eos> (Puts a hand on her shoulder) <eos> I return before too long <eos> (Puts a hand behind her head) <eos> You 'll be strong without me <eos> (She nods , and he kisses her) <eos> The North will be yours <eos> Do you believe me <question>

 <open-exp> Jaime awakens to find Bronn standing over him with a knife <eos> His eyes widens and he moves to the side as Bronn brings his knife down on a snake that was about to bite Jaime <eos> Jaime looks at the snake and Bronn pulls his knife out of it <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Breakfast <eos>
 <open-exp> Bronn and Jaime sit at a fire <eos> Bronn cooks the snake while Jaime puts gloves on <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> That would have been a shit way to die <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> As far as I 've seen , they 're all shit ways to die <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Aye <eos> But your lot like to give the singers a good ending <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> I don 't care what 's sung about me when I 'm dead <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> No <question> Two knights , off to rescue a princess <eos> Sounds like a good song to me <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Sounds like all the rest <eos>
 <open-exp> While Bronn is distracted eating , Jaime gets rid of his food <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> What about you <question> What shit way would you choose <question>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> In my own keep , drinking my own wine , watching my sons grovel for my fortune <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> How disappointing <eos> I thought you 'd have something more exciting planned <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> I 've had an exciting life <eos> I want my death to be boring <eos> How do you want to go <question>

 <boname> BRONN <eoname> What 's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister 's in Dorne <question>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> A bag of gold <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> I 'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> It was a heavy bag <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it <eos> But you won 't be around if he breaks them <eos>
 <open-exp> A horse neighs in the distance <eos> Jaime looks around <eos> A group of Dornish riders approach <eos> Bronn and Jaime hide in the grass <eos> Jaime watches the riders <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> How many you count <question>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Four <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> How many you think you can take <question>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> One , if he 's slow <eos>
 <open-exp> Bronn turns to look at the riders <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> RIDER <eoname> Halt <exclamation>
 <open-exp> The rider holds up his hand , and the party stops , having spotted Jaime and Bronn 's footsteps <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Fucked in the arse <eos> (Both get up) <eos> Hiya <exclamation> (The riders approach them) <eos> Morning , lads <eos> Glad we found you <eos>

 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Accent gave me away <question> Flea Bottom <eos> Whelped and whipped <eos>
 <boname> RIDER <eoname> Why are you here <question>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Our ship capsized in the night <eos> We managed to swim ashore <eos> It was a near thing , really <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> I thought the sharks would get us <eos> (Bronn looks at him) <eos>
 <boname> RIDER <eoname> There are no sharks in Dorne <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> I could have sworn those were shark fins <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Dolphins maybe <eos>
 <boname> RIDER <eoname> Throw your swords in the sand <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Boys , there 's no need for this <eos> Just , point us in the right direction <eos> We 'll find our way home <eos>
 <boname> RIDER <eoname> Swords in the sand <exclamation> Now <exclamation>
 <open-exp> Bronn and Jaime look at each other <eos> They pull out their swords <eos> Bronn puts his down in the sand , and then flings a knife into the throat of a rider <eos> He then kills another , stabbing him and knocking him off of his horse <eos> A third charges him , and Bronn knocks him off of his horse as well <eos> However , he survives <eos> Bronn turns to Jaime <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> That one should be slow enough <eos>
 <open-exp> Bronn approaches the fourth and final rider <eos> Jaime turns to the injured rider , who is revealed to be much larger than Jaime <eos> They begin fighting <eos> In the background , Bronn knocks the fourth rider off of his horse <eos> As Jaime and the man fight , Jaime is slowly pushed back , down a hill <eos> He falls over and begins rolling to escape his attacker <eos> He loses his balance and his sword is knocked away <eos> As the attacker brings his sword down to kill Jaime , Jaime brings his gold hand up to block it <eos> The sword gets stuck in Jaime 's hand <eos> As the attacker is stuck trying to remove the sword , Jaime picks his back up , kills him , and kicks him down the hill <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Nice move <exclamation> (Jaime turns to him) <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Luck <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> You had a wonderful teacher <eos>
 <open-exp> Bronn turns and walks away <eos> Jaime looks back down the hill , and then to his hand <eos> Failing to shake the sword off , he is forced to dislodge it by kicking it out of his own hand <eos> Bronn is then seen cleaning his sword off on the clothes of one of the dead riders <eos> He sheaths his sword as Jaime approaches <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Always wanted a Dornish stallion <eos> Beasts can run a day and night without tiring <eos> We 'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> First we need to bury these bodies <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Birds have to eat too <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Corpses raise questions , questions raise armies <eos> We 're not here to start a war <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes <question>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> (Holding out his hand) <eos> I can 't dig very well with one hand <eos> Not at all , really <eos>
 <open-exp> Jaime walks away as Bronn 's face drops <eos> He begins dragging a body <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> ELARIA <eoname> Prince Doran will weep for your father , but nothing else <eos> We must avenge Oberyn ourselves <eos>
 <boname> OBARA <eoname> Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters <eos>
 <boname> ELARIA <eoname> We don 't need an army to start a war <eos> (Drinks water) <eos> Queen Cersei loves her children , and we have one of them <eos>
 <boname> NYMERIA <eoname> We may have a problem <eos>
 <open-exp> Nymeria uses a whip to knock a bucket away <eos> Underneath is the captain who brought Jaime and Bronn to Dorne , buried neck-deep in sand and covered in scorpions <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> OBARA <eoname> A ship 's captain , who found me in Planky Town , claiming he had information to sell <eos> He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne <eos>
 <boname> ELARIA <eoname> He 's come for Myrcella <eos> If he gets to her before we do , we lose our only chance for revenge <eos> You must choose <eos> Doran 's way and peace , or my way and war <eos>
 <boname> TYENE <eoname> (Walks towards her) <eos> I 'm with you <eos> Always <eos> (Elaria puts a hand to her face) <eos>
 <boname> ELARIA <eoname> Nym <question> (Nymeria nods) <eos> Obara <question>

 <open-exp> Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said , "Girl or boy , we fight our battles <eos> But the Gods let us choose our weapons <eos>" My father pointed to the spear , and then to my mother 's tears <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> Obara picks up a spear that was sticking out of the sand <eos> She twirls it around for a moment , and then tosses it through the captain 's head , killing him <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> OBARA <eoname> (Smiles) <eos> I made my choice long ago <eos>
 <open-exp> Elaria and Tyene smile <eos> <close-exp>

 <open-exp> Jorah steers the boat as Tyrion , tied up and gagged , tries to speak <eos> He only succeeds in mumbling <eos> Eventually he stops trying to say real words , and instead only tries to be as loud as possible , to annoy Jorah <eos> Jorah comes over and ungags him , and then walks back over to continue steering <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Gold and glory <eos> Oh , and hate <eos> If you 've ever met my sister , you 'd understand <eos> So now that it 's clear we 're on the same side <question> (Holds out his hands expectantly <eos> Jorah makes no move to respond) <eos> A high born knight from the North of Westeros , down on his luck in Essos <eos> Dragon epaulettes <question> Bear sigil breast plate <eos> You 're Jorah Mormont <eos> I have to ask how , exactly , were you serving your Queen in a whore house , half a world away <question> Is it possible , that you were running <question> Why would you be running <question> And why would she have sent you away <question> Oh , wait <exclamation> You were spying on her , weren 't you <question> It 's all coming back to me <exclamation> I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings , but it 's all coming back <eos> You passed notes to Varys 's little birds <eos> She found out , didn 't she <question> Found out , and exiled you <eos> (Jorah looks downtrodden) <eos> And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift <eos> A risky scheme <eos> One might even say , desperate <eos> Do you think Daenerys would execute me , and pardon you <question> I 'd say the reverse is just as likely <eos>
 <open-exp> Jorah stops steering and approaches Tyrion <eos> Tyrion holds out his hands again , but Jorah strikes him , knocking him unconscious <eos> He then goes back to steering , looking worried <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Why <question>
 <boname> BARRISTAN <eoname> He liked to walk among the people , he liked to sing to them <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> He sang to them <question>
 <boname> BARRISTAN <eoname> Yes <eos> Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he 'd sing <eos> Just like all the other minstrels <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> And what did you do <question>
 <boname> BARRISTAN <eoname> I made sure no one killed him <eos> And I collected the money <eos> (Daenerys looks surprised) <eos> Well he liked to see how much he could make <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> He was good <question>
 <boname> BARRISTAN <eoname> He was very good <eos> Viserys never told you <question>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people <eos> (Sits down) <eos>
 <boname> BARRISTAN <eoname> Rhaegar never liked killing <eos> He loved singing <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> And what did you do with the money <question>
 <boname> BARRISTAN <eoname> Well , one time , he gave it to the next minstrel down the street <eos> One time , he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom <eos> One time <eos> <eos> <eos> we got horribly drunk <eos> (They both laugh) <eos>

 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> Why else do men fight <question> Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms <question> So their names would live on <eos> Those who find victory in the fighting pits , will never become kings , but their names will live on <eos> It 's the best chance they 'll ever have <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport <question>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> Your Grace , today is the traditional start of the fighting season <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> I do not recognize this tradition <eos>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city , your city , together <eos> (Shots of Sons of the Harpy walking through tunnels with torches) <eos> Without them , former slaves and former masters have nothing in common <eos> Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment <eos> I can 't promise this is the answer to all our problems , but it 's a start <eos>
 <open-exp> EXT <eos> MARKETPLACE <close-exp>
 <open-exp> A prostitute and a soldier laugh with each other <eos> Another soldier talks with some women <eos> Some Sons of the Harpy kill all of the soldiers in the area , causing panic <eos> In a nearby alley , some Unsullied march <eos> Hearing the chaos , they begin running towards the market <eos> They find the prostitute crying over the body of the dead soldier <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> WOMAN <eoname> (Speaking another language) Sons of the Harpy <eos>
 <open-exp> She gestures in the direction the sons went <eos> The Unsullied run in that direction <eos> When they are out of view , she stops her act and wipes the tears away <eos> The Unsullied enter a corridor , expecting to catch the sons <eos> Instead , they themselves are ambushed from every direction by Sons of the Harpy <eos> After a tense few moments , a fight breaks out <eos> During the fight , one of the Unsullied 's helmet is knocked off , and is revealed to be Grey Worm <eos> Another fight breaks out elsewhere <eos> The two Unsullied there are killed almost immediately <eos> Barristan walks down an alley and , upon noticing the chaos , heads to the fighting <eos> Grey Worm is badly injured , and with his party killed , also badly outnumbered <eos> Unsullied are shown being killed elsewhere <eos> Grey Worm continues holding off the sons , and Barristan arrives to assist him <eos> They are able to kill all of the sons , but are both seriously injured in the process <eos> They fall unconscious , and the camera pans up to show them surrounded by all of the dead sons and Unsullied <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> "Barristan the Bold" they called him <eos> He crossed a continent to serve me <eos> He was a loyal friend <eos> And he died in an alley , butchered by cowards who hide behind masks <eos>
 <boname> DAARIO <eoname> We could pull back to the pyramid district , secure it , and use it as a base from which to operate <eos> Then we clean the city out , neighborhood by neighborhood , street by street , until the rats have nowhere left to hide <eos>
 <open-exp> Daario walks over the Daenerys and looks at Hizdahr <eos> He looks back <eos> Daenerys turns around <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> I prefer your earlier suggestion <eos> Round up the leaders of each of Meereen 's great families and bring them to me <eos>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> But <eos> <eos> <eos> I 'm the leader of my family <eos>
 <open-exp> Daario nods <eos> The two men behind Hizdahr grab and restrain him <eos> He is taken away <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> (Valyrian) They will eat you , if I tell them to <eos> They may eat you even if I don 't <eos> Children <eos> Some say I should give up on them <eos> (One of the men is mumbling) <eos> But a good mother never gives up on her children <eos> She disciplines them if she must <eos>
 <open-exp> Daenerys looks at Daario <eos> He walks over and pushes the mumbling man forward , onto his knees <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> (Valyrian) But she does not give up on them <eos>
 <open-exp> The man 's eyes widen <eos> A dragon comes out of the shadows and breathes fire on him <eos> He screams and dies <eos> The dragons take his corpse , tear it in two , and eat it <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> (Valyrian) Who is innocent <question> Maybe all of you are , (Looks at Hizdahr) , maybe none of you are <eos> Maybe , (Touching Hizdahr 's arm) , I should let the dragons decide <eos>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> (Valyrian) All men must die <eos>
 <open-exp> The other men besides Hizdahr grovel before Daenerys <eos> The dragons continue eating <eos> After a moment , she takes her hand off of Hizdahr <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Don 't want to overfeed them <eos> Tomorrow perhaps <eos>

 <boname> JON <eoname> What if I unchained you <question>
 <boname> TORMUND <eoname> Why would you do that <question>
 <boname> JON <eoname> Because you are not my enemy <eos> And I 'm not yours <eos>
 <boname> TORMUND <eoname> You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> For 8 , 000 years the Night 's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men <eos> And for 8 , 000 years we 've fallen short of that oath <eos> You belong to the realms of men <eos> All of you <eos>

 <boname> TORMUND <eoname> They won 't kneel for you and neither will I <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> I don 't want them to kneel for me <eos> I want them to fight with me when the time comes <eos>
 <boname> TORMUND <eoname> The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them <eos>
 <boname> JON <eoname> And how many of your people can 't fight <question> The women , the children , the old , the sick , what happens to them <question> You 're condemning them to death <eos> Worse than death because you 're too proud to make peace <eos> Or maybe you 're not proud <eos> Maybe you 're just a coward <eos>

 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> Indeed <eos> As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> We were fools to trust a turncloak <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> I would counsel patience , your grace <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Patience <question> Sansa helped murder my son , Roose Bolton is a traitor <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor , marching with his army on Winterfell <eos> Let Stannis and Roose battle , let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they 're done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Winterfell is 1 , 000 miles away from here <eos> The weather has already begun to turn <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> That is why it is critical to strike soon , while the victor still licks his wounds <eos> Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> Ser Jaime , then <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission <eos> I 've no idea when he 'll be back <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> Perhaps I can help <eos> The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros , trained to battle in the ice and the snow <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Forgive me Lord Baelish , you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper , not a military man <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> You wouldn 't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury <eos> What do you have to lose , a brothel keeper <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> And if you succeed <question>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> Name me Warden of the North <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I 'll speak to the king this evening <eos> Have him issue a royal decree <eos>
 <boname> BAELISH <eoname> I 'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> And I 'll l know you 're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark 's head on a spike <eos>

 <boname> OLENNA <eoname> Rumors and gossip , that 's all they got <eos> It 's theater , nothing more <eos> If they arrested all the pillow biters in King 's Landing there 'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else <eos>
 <boname> MARGAERY <eoname> Everyone knew about him and Renly <eos>
 <boname> OLENNA <eoname> Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms <eos> Everyone knew <eos> No one cared <eos>
 <boname> MARGAERY <eoname> But he was the king 's brother <eos>
 <boname> OLENNA <eoname> And Loras is the queen 's brother <eos> No , no , no , no , this is unacceptable <eos>
 <boname> MARGAERY <eoname> Cersei is behind this <eos>
 <boname> OLENNA <eoname> Of course she is <eos> She wants to drag our names through the dirt <eos> Put us in our place <eos> Get some rest , dear , you look appalling <eos> Let me deal with Cersei Lannister <eos>

 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> You must be exhausted <eos>
 <boname> OLENNA <eoname> Put the pen down , dear , we all know you aren 't writing anything <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Ah , yes , the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns <eos>
 <boname> OLENNA <eoname> And the famous tart Queen Cersei <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Beg your pardon <eos>
 <boname> OLENNA <eoname> I know you 're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> If you apologize for that comment perhaps--
 <boname> OLENNA <eoname> You 'll get your apology when I get Loras <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras <eos> I have no love for these fanatics <eos> But what can the queen mother do <question>
 <boname> OLENNA <eoname> Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops , gold , and wheat my house supplies <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
 <boname> OLENNA <eoname> Do you expect the alliance to continue after you 've thrown our future into prison <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> As I said , i didn 't imprison anyone <eos> As for your veiled threats--
 <boname> OLENNA <eoname> What veil <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country <eos> Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare <question>
 <boname> OLENNA <eoname> I didn 't trust your father <eos> I didn 't particularly like him <eos> But I respected him <eos> He was no fool <eos> He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> House Lannister has no rival <eos> The High Septon has called for an inquest , not a trial <eos> Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit , which I 'm sure they don 't <eos> Loras will be freed , our happy alliance will continue , and we 'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened <eos> Good day , Lady Olenna <eos>
 <open-exp> INT <eos> HIGH SEPTON 'S ROOM <close-exp>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly <question>
 <boname> LORAS <eoname> I don 't pay attention to rumors <eos>
 <boname> SPARROW <eoname> You were said to be despondent when he died <eos> Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside , even as Stannis ' army closed in
 <boname> LORAS <eoname> He was my friend <eos> He was my king <eos>
 <boname> SPARROW <eoname> Wasn 't Joffrey your king <question> He was anointed by the 7 , not Renly <eos>
 <boname> LORAS <eoname> I was wrong to support Renly 's claim <eos> I know that <eos> But I was forgiven by Joffrey <eos> I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater <eos>
 <boname> SPARROW <eoname> Wearing Renly 's armor <eos>
 <boname> LORAS <eoname> Why does it matter what I wore <question>
 <boname> SPARROW <eoname> Do you deny all of the charges against you <question> Fornication , buggery , blasphemy <eos>
 <boname> LORAS <eoname> Of course I deny them <eos>
 <boname> SPARROW <eoname> You never lay with Renly Baratheon <eos>
 <boname> LORAS <eoname> Never <eos>
 <boname> SPARROW <eoname> Nor any other man <eos>

 <boname> SPARROW <eoname> Yes <eos> We have some questions for you <eos>

 <boname> OLYVAR <eoname> I squired for him <eos> He took a liking to me <eos> He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met <eos>
 <boname> SPARROW <eoname> And what occurred in his chamber <question>
 <boname> OLYVAR <eoname> We engaged in intimate relations <eos>
 <boname> SPARROW <eoname> You laid with him <question>

 <boname> LORAS <eoname> Liar <exclamation> He 's a liar <exclamation>
 <boname> SPARROW <eoname> Is there anyone else who can support your claim <question>
 <boname> OLYVAR <eoname> Yes , yes , Queen Margaery <eos> She walked in on us once not long ago <eos> She didn 't seem surprised <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> This testimony is an insult to a great house <eos> Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden <question>
 <boname> OLYVAR <eoname> He has a birthmark , your grace <eos> Quite high on his thigh , wine-colored , and roughly the shape of Dorne <eos>

 <boname> MARGAERY <eoname> What <question>
 <boname> SPARROW <eoname> Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any <eos> Take her <eos>

 <boname> JORAH <eoname> Your Grace , I want to say--
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> You will not speak <eos> How do I know you are who you say you are <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> If only I were otherwise <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn 't I kill you <question> To pay your family back for what it did to mine
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> You want revenge against the Lannisters <question> I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born <eos> I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart <eos> I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Into your service <question> Your Grace we have only just met <eos> It 's too soon to know if you deserve my service <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> If you 'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory <eos> She had no wealth , no lands , no army , only a name and a handful of supporters , most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves <eos> They kept her alive , moving her from place to place , often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her <eos> She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that <eos> And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth , lands , or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time , along with three dragons <eos> He thought she was our best , last chance to build a better world <eos> I thought you were worth meeting at the very least <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> And why are you worth meeting <question> Why should I spend my time listening to you <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Because you can not build a better world on your own <eos> You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule <eos> The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> I have a very large army and very large dragons <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Killing and politics aren 't always the same thing <eos> When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people <eos> I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> So you want to advise me <eos> Very well <eos> (looks to Jorah) What would you have me do with him <question> I swore I would kill him if he ever returned <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> I know <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Why should the people trust a queen who can 't keep her promises <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you , he is no longer that man <eos> I can 't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you <eos> He claims he would kill for you and die for you , and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him <eos> And yet he did betray you <eos>
 <open-exp> Tyrion approaches Daenerys and Missandei <eos> Her guards raise their spears to her <eos> Daenerys waves them off <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals <question>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Yes , many opportunities <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> And did he <question>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> No <eos> Not until forced to do so <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> He worships you <eos> He is in love with you , I think <eos> But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth , to be sure - but one of great significance to you <eos> He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> So I should kill him <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion <eos> And you 're going to need to inspire devotion , and lots of it , if you 're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea <eos> But you cannot have him by your side when you do <eos>

 <boname> SANSA <eoname> Reek <eos> Why did you tell him , Reek <question>
 <boname> THEON <eoname> I was helping you <eos> You were trying to escape , there is no escape <eos> Not ever <eos> Theon Greyjoy tried to escape <eos> The master knew <eos> He knows everything <eos> He hunted him , he caught him , he strapped him to a cross , and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> Good <eos> If it weren 't for you I 'd still have a family <eos> If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here , right now , I would <eos>
 <boname> THEON <eoname> I deserved everything <eos> I deserve to be Reek <eos> I did terrible things <eos> Turned on Robb <eos> Captured Winterfell <eos> Killed those boys <eos>
 <boname> THEON <eoname> They weren 't <boquote>those boys<eoquote> , they were Bran and Rickon <eos> They were your brothers , you 'd know them since they were born <eos>

 <boname> ROOSE <eoname> You disagree <question>
 <boname> RAMSAY <eoname> Stannis isn 't from the North <eos> You are , father <eos> I think you 're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders <eos>
 <boname> ROOSE <eoname> And what do you recommend <question>
 <boname> RAMSAY <eoname> That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be <eos> That we hit first , and hit hard , and leave a feast for the crows <eos>
 <boname> ROOSE <eoname> A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage <eos> As long as we stay behind these walls they can 't touch us <eos> Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn 't get an army through if we wanted to <eos>

 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Have you decided yet whether you 're going to have me killed <question>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> It 's probably my safest option <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> I can see why you would think so <eos> It 's what your father would have done <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> And what would your father do <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> My father <question> Who publicly sentenced me to death <question> I 'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Is that why you killed him <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Some day if you decide not to execute me , I 'll tell you all about why I killed my father <eos> And on that day , should it ever come , we 'll need more wine than this <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> I know what my father was <eos> What he did <eos> I know the Mad King earned his name <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> So here we sit , two terrible children of two terrible fathers <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> I 'm terrible <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> I 've heard stories <eos>
 <boname> DANERYS <eoname> Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> To see if you were the right kind of terrible <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Which kind is that <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> The kind that prevents your people from being even more so <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> I did reopen the fighting pits <eos> Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Yes , that was wise <eos> And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good <eos> Very impressive <eos> My own sister married someone she loathed as well , though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good , Gods forbid <eos> She ended up having him killed <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Perhaps it won 't come to that <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> It 's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Varys <question> King Robert 's spy master <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Yes <eos> He was the one who convinced me to come find you <eos> He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Jorah sent my secrets to Varys <eos> For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> He did what he had to do to survive <eos> He did a lot of other things that he didn 't have to do <eos> I suspect he 's the main reason you weren 't slaughtered in your crib <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> But you trust him <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Yes , oddly <eos> He might be the only person in the world that I trust <eos> Besides my brother <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> The brother who killed my father <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> That 's the one <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Perhaps I will have you killed after all <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Your queenly prerogative <eos> I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for <eos> You chop off my head <question> Well , my final days were interesting <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> I 'm not going to kill you <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> No <question> Banish me <question>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> No <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> So if I 'm not going to be murdered , and I 'm not going to be banished <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> You 're going to advise me <eos> (takes his wine cup) While you can still speak in complete sentences <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Advise you on what <question>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> How to get what I want <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> The Iron Throne <eos> Perhaps you should try wanting something else <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> If I want jokes I 'll get myself a proper fool <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> I 'm not entirely joking <eos> There 's more to the world than Westeros after all <eos> How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here <question> Perhaps this is where you belong <eos> Where you can do the most good <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> I fought so that no child born into Slaver 's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold <eos> I will continue that fight here and beyond <eos> But this is not my home <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> And when you get back to your home , who supports you <question>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> The common people <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Let 's be generous and assume that 's going to happen <eos> Here in Slaver 's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people <eos> What was that like , ruling without the rich <question> House Targaryen is gone , not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you <eos> The Starks are gone as well , our two terrible fathers saw to that <eos> The remaining Lannisters won 't back you , not ever <eos> Stannis Baratheon won 't back you either , his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours <eos> That leaves the Tyrells <eos> Not impossible , but not enough <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Lannister , Targaryen , Baratheon , Stark , Tyrell <eos> They 're all just spokes on a wheel <eos> This one 's on top , then that ones on top and on and on it spins , crushing the people on the ground <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> It 's a beautiful dream <eos> Stopping the wheel <eos> You 're not the first person to have dreamt it <eos>

 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> We 're still getting a count , but hundreds are dead <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm <question>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> The northerners know more about their land than we ever will <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Put last night 's guards in chains , either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy <eos> Find out the truth and then hang them <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> Unless there 's a thaw , we can 't press forward to Winterfell , and we don 't have enough food to get us back to Castle Black <eos>

 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> Your Grace , you 've named me your Hand <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Yes <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> The King 's Hand should never abandon the King , especially in a time of war <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> You 're not abandoning me , you 're obeying a command <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> A boy with a scroll could deliver this message <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll , what does the boy say <question> I didn 't name you hand for your expertise in military matters , ride for Castle Black , don 't come back empty handed <eos>

 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> "The Dance of Dragons A True Telling" by Grand Maester Munkun <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> Well that sounds like a proper story <eos>
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar <eos> He polished his shield for a week , til the steel was like a mirror <eos> Then he crouched behind it , and crept forward , hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> But the dragon only saw a dumb man , holding a mirrored shield <eos>
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> And burnt him to a crisp <eos>
 <open-exp> Davos and Shireen share a laugh <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> Of course I will <eos>
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> But why am I getting a present <question>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> Because you deserve it <eos> My son was always on me trying to teach me to read <eos> Gods , I was stubborn about it <eos> Made it this far without reading , seemed to me I could make it to the grave <eos> I wish I had listened to them <eos> This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up <eos> (beat) I 'll be gone for a few days , Princess <eos> I 'll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I 'm back <eos>

 <open-exp> Jaime looks up from his writing at Ellaria <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> ELLARIA <eoname> You think I disapprove <eos> Why <question> Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from <question> They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from <eos> Here , no one blinked an eye <eos> 100 years ago , no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen <eos> It 's always changing , who we 're supposed to love and who we 're not <eos>The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want <eos>

 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> Father <eos> Aren 't you cold <question>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> No <eos> What are you reading <question>
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> The Dance of Dragons <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> What 's it about <question>
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> It 's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms <eos> Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne <eos> When people started for declaring for one of them or the other , their fight divided the kingdom in two <eos> Brothers fought brothers <eos> Dragons fought dragons <eos> By the time it was over , thousands were dead <eos> And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well <eos> They never truly recovered <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> <boquote>The dance of dragons<eoquote> <question> Why is that a dance <question>
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> That 's just what they call it <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Doesn 't make much sense <eos>
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> I think it 's poetic <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon , who would you have chosen <question>
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> I wouldn 't have chosen either <eos> It 's all the choosing sides that made things so horrible <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Sometimes a person has to choose <eos> Sometimes the world forces his hand <eos> If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself , the choice is not choice at all <eos> He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be <eos> However much he may hate it <eos>
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> It 's alright , father <eos>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> You don 't even know what I 'm talking about <eos>
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> It doesn 't matter <eos> I want to help you <eos> Is there any way I can help <question>
 <boname> STANNIS <eoname> Yes there is <eos>
 <boname> SHIREEN <eoname> Good , I want to <eos> I 'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I 'm your daughter <eos>

 <boname> ANNOUNCER <eoname> My queen , our first contest <eos> Who will triumph the strong or the quick <question>
 <boname> QUICK <eoname> I fight and die for your glory , oh glorious queen <eos>
 <boname> STRONG <eoname> I fight and die for your glory , oh glorious queen <eos>
 <open-exp> They stand waiting in front of her <eos> The crowd is silent <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> They 're waiting for you <eos> Clap your hands <eos>
 <open-exp> Daenerys looks down at the two men <eos> After a moment , and with a look of disgust on her face , she claps her hands <eos> The crowd roars and they start fighting <eos> After some parries , the Quick man slices at the Strong man 's neck <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAARIO <eoname> That one , the smaller man , no question , that 's where you should put your money <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> The smaller man it is <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> I 'm not putting my money anywhere <eos>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> Kings and queens never bet on the games <eos> Perhaps you should go find someone who does <eos>
 <boname> DAARIO <eoname> People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits <eos> (looks at Hizdahr) He would have bet against me <eos> Common novice mistake <eos>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> I have spent much of my life in Meereen , and in my experience , larger men do triumph over smaller man , far more often than not <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting <question> You , yourself , have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you <question>
 <open-exp> Hizdahr is silent <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAARIO <eoname> Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one , the crowd saw me , all skin and bone back then , then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me <eos> They couldn 't get their money out fast enough <eos> But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here (he puts a dagger to his neck) or here (he puts the dagger to Hizdahr 's neck) <eos> And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren 't <eos> Yes , whenever I saw a beast like that one , standing across from me making his beast faces , I knew I could rest easy <eos>
 <open-exp> The Strong man decapitates the Quick man with one quick stroke <eos> Hizdahr smiles and Daario looks turns away angrily <eos> Tyrion says nothing <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> You don 't approve <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> There 's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste <eos> I can do without it in my leisure time <eos>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> Fair enough , yet -- it 's an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> It 's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be <eos> Especially when what is has worked in your favor <eos>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> I 'm not talking about myself <eos> I 'm talking about the necessary conditions of greatness <eos>
 <open-exp> Cut to pit workers carrying the decapitated head out of the pit , leaving a trail of blood behind <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> That is greatness <question>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen <eos> Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> My father would have liked you <eos>
 <boname> ANNOUNCER <eoname> We ask again who will triumph <question>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> One day your great city will return to the dirt as well <eos>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> At your command <question>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> If need be <eos>
 <boname> ANNOUNCER <eoname> A Meereenese champion <question>
 <open-exp> The crowd applauds <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> How many people will die to make this happen <question>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason <eos>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> Those men think they 're dying for a good reason <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS <eoname> Someone else 's reason <eos>
 <boname> HIZDAHR <eoname> So your reasons are true , and theirs are false <eos> They don 't know their own minds , but you do <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Well said , you 're an eloquent man <eos> Doesn 't mean you 're wrong <eos> In my experience , eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles <eos>

 <boname> TYRION <eoname> We 'll be fine <eos> We 're dressed like common merchants <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> You walk like a rich person <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> You 've spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk <question>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property <eos> I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> It 's a good thing you 're not a boy anymore <eos> <eos> <eos>because you have no cock <eos>

 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Hard to know <eos> Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> The Sons of the Harpy <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Very possibly <eos> Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property , told them human beings weren 't even property to begin with <eos> You can see why they 're unhappy <eos> Of course , it could also be the freed men <eos>
 <open-exp> TYRION and VARYS enter a chamber where a red priest is preaching to a group of listeners <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> LISTENERS <eoname> For the night is dark and full of terrors <eos>
 <boname> RED_PRIEST <eoname> The Lord of Light sent the Mother of Dragons to you , and those who love the darkness chased her away <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> She did fly away on a dragon and not come back <eos>
 <boname> RED_PRIEST <eoname> How will you respond <question> Will you wring your hands , while you wait for the Mother of Dragons to return <question> Or will you you take up her flames yourselves <question> Will you fight for your own salvation , now that Queen Daenerys is not here to fight for you <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> It 's a problem <eos>
 <open-exp> TYRION and VARYS proceed in a much larger courtyard <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill <eos> Whoever you are , wherever you go , someone in this city wants to murder you <eos> We can 't fight an enemy we don 't know <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully , which means they take orders from someone <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> And have you started looking for that someone <question>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> My little birds have already taken wing <eos> Soon they 'll return , singing songs of men in gold masks <eos>
 <open-exp> Men are shouting in the distance <eos> A bell begins to toll <eos> A flood of people run through an archway on the opposite side of the courtyard toward TYRION and VARYS , then run past them <eos> TYRION and VARYS proceed through the archway and into the harbor <eos> Smoke pours from the burning wreckage of all the ships in the harbor <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> BALON <eoname> And I lost three sons <eos> The War of the Five Kings , they call it <eos> Well , the other four are dead <eos> When you rule the Iron Islands , you can wage all the peace you wan <eos> But for now , shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will <eos>

 <open-exp> BALON walks towards his brother <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BALON <eoname> I heard you lost your mind during the storm on the Jade Sea <eos> They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard <eos>
 <boname> EURON <eoname> They did <eos>
 <boname> BALON <eoname> And when the storm passed , you cut out their tongues <eos>
 <boname> EURON <eoname> I needed silence <eos>
 <boname> BALON <eoname> What kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm <question>
 <boname> EURON <eoname> I am the storm , brother <eos> The first storm and the last <eos> And you 're in my way <eos>

 <boname> ALL <eoname> What is dead may never die <eos>
 <boname> YARA <eoname> I 'm going to find out who did this <eos> I 'm going to feed them to the sharks while they live <eos> I swear it by the Salt Throne <eos>
 <boname> AERON <eoname> The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon , not unless the kingsmoot chooses you <eos>
 <boname> YARA <eoname> My father would 've wanted me to rule <eos>
 <boname> AERON <eoname> Your father does not get to choose <eos> The law is clear <eos> Perhaps you 'll win <eos> Perhaps you 'll be the first woman in history to rule the Ironborn <eos> And perhaps not <eos>

 <boname> VALA <eoname> The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> I understand <eos> Well , that makes perfect sense from your perspective <eos> I have a different perspective , of course <eos> I think it 's important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours <eos> Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy <eos> That is how you pronounce it -- Dom <question> I 'm afraid I don 't really speak the language <eos> Such a handsome boy <eos> Those big , brown eyes <eos> Good luck keeping the ladies away <eos>
 <boname> VALA <eoname> Yes , you 're a true liberator , aren 't you <question> You won 't torture me , you 'll just threaten my son <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Children are blameless <eos> I have never hurt them <eos> Your boy is in no immediate danger , this I swear to you <eos> But between us , dear , you did conspire to kill the queen 's soldiers <eos> We both know the penalty for that crime <eos> How will poor Dom get on without his mother <question> And with his breathing problem <eos>
 <boname> VALA <eoname> If I tell you anything , they 'll kill me <eos> So either you kill me or they do <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Yes , from your perspective , this is a problem <eos> There is a third option , though <eos> A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos <eos> I 've already booked passage for a woman and her young son <eos> I 'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again <eos>

 <boname> TOMMEN <eoname> You 've cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city <eos> That wasn 't a full atonement <question>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> No <eos> She must stand trial before seven septons , so we can learn the true extant of her sins <eos>

 <boname> TOMMEN <eoname> My grandfather once said something similar <eos> Except for the part about the gods <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not <eos> As they work through your mother <eos> There 's so much good in all of us <eos> The best we can do is to help each other bring it out <eos>

 <boname> SMALLJON <eoname> Your father was a cunt and that 's why you killed him <eos> I might 've done the same to my father , if he hadn 't have done me the favor of dying on his own <eos>
 <boname> RAMSAY <eoname> My father was poisoned by our enemies <eos>
 <boname> SMALLJON <eoname> Mmm <eos>
 <boname> RAMSAY <eoname> Why have you come to Winterfell , Lord Umber <question>
 <boname> SMALLJON <eoname> The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall <eos> We 're farther north than any of you fuckers <eos> Wildlings come down , we always have to fight them first <eos> I like fighting wildlings , been doing it all my life <eos> But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone <eos>

 <boname> SMALLJON <eoname> We need to help each other <eos> The colder it gets , the farther South those goat fuckers will roam <eos> Won 't take them long to get here <eos>
 <boname> LORD_KARSTARK <eoname> You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell <question>
 <boname> SMALLJON <eoname> If they get Jon Snow leading them , maybe <eos> He knows this place better than we ever will <eos>

 <boname> SMALLJON <eoname> Your father honored tradition <eos> Knelt for Robb Stark <eos> Called him King of the North <eos> Was Robb Stark right to trust your father <question>
 <boname> RAMSAY <eoname> Then it appears we 're at a bit of an impasse <eos>

 <boname> SANSA <eoname> There 's only one place we can go <eos> Home <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave <question>

 <boname> SANSA <eoname> How many wildlings did you save <question>

 <boname> LITTLEFINGER <eoname> On our way to the Fingers , we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men <eos> Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting <eos>

 <boname> GREY_WORM <eoname> You invite the enemy into our city <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> I did <eos> As a clever man once told me , <boquote>We make peace with our enemies , not our friends <eos><eoquote>
 <open-exp> TYRION begins walking away <eos> The others follow <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> GREY_WORM <eoname> I don 't make peace with the queen 's enemies <eos> I kill the queen 's enemies <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Yes , that 's the military approach <eos> And how has that worked here in Meereen <question> I represent the diplomatic approach <eos>
 <open-exp> TYRION and VARYS begin ascending the stairs to the Great Pyramid <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MISSANDEI <eoname> Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her <eos>
 <open-exp> TYRION and VARYS turn back to face MISSANDEI and GREY WORM <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> TYRION We enter these negotiations with open eyes <eos> Trust me <eos> My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MISSANDEI <eoname> How many days were you a slave <question>
 <open-exp> TYRION stammers <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Long enough to know <eos>

 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Let 's make this simple , shall we <question> Tell me what you want <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Queen Daenerys won 't stay in Meereen forever <eos> Her path takes her westward <eos>
 <boname> MISSANDEI <eoname> She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men , women , and children still lived in chains <eos>
 <boname> GREY_WORM <eoname> Not anymore <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Friends , friends , friends , please <eos>
 <open-exp> GREY WORM stares intently at MASTER #1 <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing <eos> That is the way of the world <eos> I 'm not here to change the way of the world <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> You don 't need slaves to make money <eos> There haven 't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you <eos> But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it <eos> So here is the queen 's proposal <eos> Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver 's Bay time to adjust to the new order <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Instead of abolishing slavery overnight , we will give you seven years to end the practice <eos>
 <open-exp> The masters look at each others <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses , of course , at fair prices <eos> In exchange , you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Fine , fine , but you will cut it off all the same <eos> I do hope you accept , my friends <eos> You will not receive a better offer <eos>
 <open-exp> TYRION picks up a bell from the table beside him and rings it <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it <eos> And as a parting gift to our honored guests<ellipsis>
 <open-exp> Three women enter <eos> Each one sits in the lap of one of the masters <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> TYRION <eoname> My friends <exclamation> Large sorry <eos> <eos> <eos>you wait so fat time <eos>
 <boname> MISSANDEI <eoname> Perhaps I should translate for you <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Excellent <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> I did <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled <eos>
 <open-exp> TYRION begins to descend the steps towards the men <eos> MISSANDEI and GREY WORM follow <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> But I am not your ruler <eos> I 'm not the Breaker of Chains <eos> I 'm not the Unburnt <eos> And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons <eos>
 <open-exp> TYRION and company reach the bottom of the steps so they are face to face with the men <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Because our queen chose me as her advisor <eos> Until she returns from her travels --
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Soon <eos> You have my word <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations <eos> As commander of the Unsullied , he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> We offered terms <eos>
 <boname> GREY_WORM <eoname> I am a soldier , not a politician <eos> But if there is a chance for peace -- a just peace -- we should take it <eos>
 <boname> MISSANDEI <eoname> I do not trust them <eos> I will never trust them <eos>
 <open-exp> MISSANDEI pauses and looks at TYRION <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Those men respect you <eos>
 <boname> GREY_WORM <eoname> They respect me because they know who I am <eos> They know I am loyal <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> As do I <eos>
 <boname> GREY_WORM <eoname> I am loyal to my queen , not you <eos> If you betray her work , you are my enemy <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> I am not betraying her work <eos> I am trying to save her city <eos>
 <boname> MISSANDEI <eoname> You promised the slavers they could keep slavery <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> For a short time <eos>
 <boname> MISSANDEI <eoname> Seven years is not a short time for a slave <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> You 're right <eos> Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once <eos> War is a horror that should be ended at once <eos> I can 't do both today <eos>
 <boname> GREY_WORM <eoname> You are wrong to trust these men <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> I don 't trust the Masters <eos> I trust their self-interest <eos> They 're trustworthy if they 're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest <eos>
 <boname> GREY_WORM <eoname> You don 't know them <eos> You don 't understand them <eos> We are not human in their eyes <eos> They look at me and see a weapon <eos> They look at her and see a whore <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast <eos> Their contempt is their weakness <eos> They 'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage <eos>
 <boname> GREY_WORM <eoname> You will not use them <eos> They will use you <eos> That is what they do <eos>

 <open-exp> MARGAERY is sitting in the corner of her cell <eos> SEPTA UNELLA enters , then guides MARGAERY out into the prayer room where the HIGH SPARROW waits <eos> MARGAERY walks into the room and shields her eyes from the sunlight <eos> SEPTA UNELLA pushes MARGAERY to her knees , then exits <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> If I were to let you leave right now , where would you go <question> What would you seek out <question>
 <boname> MARGAERY <eoname> I 'd go to my brother , my husband , my family <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> Of course , but for you , that means seeking out money , finery , power <eos> Seeking out your family means seeking out sin <eos> I 'm not maligning you <eos> I sought those things out , too <eos> To the exclusion of all else <eos> My father was a cobbler <eos> He died with I was young and I took over his shop <eos> He was a simple man and he made simple shoes <eos> But I found that the more work I put into my shoes , the more people wanted them <eos> Fine leather , ornamentation , detailing , and time <eos> Time most of all <eos> Dozens of hours spent on a single pair <eos>
 <boname> MARGAERY <eoname> Quality takes time <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> Yes <eos> I imagine you 've worn a year of someone 's life on your back <eos> The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege <eos> I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself <eos> Each time I indulged , I felt myself ascending to something better <eos>
 <boname> MARGAERY <eoname> And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness <eos> Book of the Stranger , verse 25 <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> You know The Seven-Pointed Star <eos>
 <boname> MARGAERY <eoname> Septa Unella reads it to me <eos> At me <eos>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> Yes , yes , she does enjoy reading at people <eos> You 're close <eos> But it wasn 't a graveyard <eos> It was a feast <eos> I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all <eos> We passed around the wine , passed around the women , and soon we fell into a stupor <eos> I woke before dawn <eos> I could barely stand <eos> Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor , lying in heaps next to their fine clothes <eos> The truth of their bodies laid bare <eos> I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn <eos> And I saw it with perfect clarity <eos> I saw what my sins were <eos> The gold I had , the wine I drank , the women I used , my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position <eos> It was all part of a story <eos> A story I was telling myself about who I was <eos> A collection of lies that would disappear in the light <eos> The people I was trying to climb away from , the beggars in the street , the poor , they were closer to the truth than I ever was <eos>
 <boname> MARGAERY <eoname> So what did you do <question>
 <boname> HIGH_SPARROW <eoname> I left to go and find them <eos> I didn 't even put on my shoes <eos> I walked out the door and never went back <eos>

 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Is this a Small Council meeting <question>
 <boname> MAESTER_PYCELL <eoname> Obviously not <eos> I 'm here to lend my wisdom and my support <eos>
 <boname> TOMMEN <eoname> Thank you for your counsel , Grand Maester <eos> That will be all for now <eos>

 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Since I 've missed the past several Small Coucil meetings , I wanted to speak to you about a few things <eos>
 <boname> TOMMEN <eoname> I 've been thinking about the High Sparrow <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> As have we all , unfortunately <eos>
 <boname> TOMMEN <eoname> We need to be careful in dealing with such a man <eos> To prevent things from escalating any further <eos> We have to be careful not to antagonize him <eos> He has Margaery <eos> We can 't put her at risk <eos> He 's dangerous <eos>
 <open-exp> CERSEI takes TOMMEN by the chin <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Look at me <eos> What did they do to me <question> To the king 's own mother <question>
 <open-exp> TOMMEN looks down <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> It 's all right <eos> It 's done <eos> It 's in the past <eos> And of course Margaery 's safety is paramount <eos>
 <boname> TOMMEN <eoname> You don 't like Margaery , do you <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant <eos> Margaery is the queen <eos> Queens must command respect <eos> Kings even more so <eos> Not just for their own sake , but for everyone 's <eos> The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens <eos> No respect for anything in this world <eos> He has no use for the things of this world <eos> He want to knock them down and replace them with what <question> With fantasies <eos> With beggars in the street <eos> With nothing <eos>
 <boname> TOMMEN <eoname> Mother <eos> <eos> <eos>there 's something I want to tell you <eos> Something the High Sparrow told me <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> You 've spoken with him <question>
 <boname> TOMMEN <eoname> I promised him I wouldn 't tell anyone <eos> If he found out I told --
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly , given his constant prattling about the truth <eos> I am your mother <eos> You can always trust me <eos>

 <open-exp> KEVIN and LADY OLENNA stand up <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> LADY_OLENNA <eoname> I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time <eos> You 're not welcome <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one 's rivals <eos>
 <boname> LADY_OLENNA <eoname> My dear , you have been stripped of your dignity and authority , publicly shamed , and confined to the Red Keep <eos> What 's left to work with <question>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Cersei is the mother of the king <eos> She has the king 's ear and his trust <eos> And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we 'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back <eos> Here we are <eos> Well done to us <eos> Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty , peasant hands <eos> In a few days , he 'll have a trial for me <eos> But before that , Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement <eos> Yes , Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city <eos>
 <boname> LADY_OLENNA <eoname> Oh , no <eos> That cannot happen <eos> That will not happen <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I agree <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> You 've got the second largest army in Westeros <eos> You 'll bring them into the city , stop queen Margaery 's humiliation before it starts , and take her back into Crown custody <eos>
 <boname> KEVAN <eoname> The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen 's safety <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> You 'll take no action at all <eos> When the Tyrell armies come , you will stand down <eos> Are you expressly forbidden from standing down <question>
 <boname> KEVAN <eoname> No , but if the king should call on me --
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything <eos> When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead , preferably , and Margaery 's back at Tommen 's side , do you think the king will be angry at the outcome <question>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> You hate these fanatics as much as we do <eos> You hate what they 've done to your son <eos> Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good <question>
 <boname> KEVAN <eoname> Of course I want him back <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed <eos>
 <boname> KEVAN <eoname> If it doesn 't go as planned , the Sparrows have many friends in the city <eos> We 'll have civil war <eos> Many will die <eos>
 <boname> LADY_OLENNA <eoname> Many will die no matter what we do <eos> Better them than us <eos>

 <boname> MISSANDEI <eoname> The people know who brought them freedom <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Yes , but do they know who brought them security <question> Who brought about an end to the violence <question> We need someone the people trust , someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Sounds like quite the hero <eos> Where would we find him <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Who said anything about <boquote>him<eoquote> <question>
 <boname> CUT_TO <eoname> MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER
 <open-exp> TYRION and VARYS stand on the plateau above the audience chamber <eos> A woman stans at the bottom of the steps , and a man stand a few steps in front of her <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MAN <eoname> You stand in the presence of Kinvara , High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis , the Flame of Truth , the Light of Wisdom , the First Servant of the Lord of Light <eos>
 <open-exp> The man steps aside <eos> KINVARA walks up a few steps <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Welcome to Meereen <eos>
 <open-exp> KINVARA stops on the middle plateau <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> That 's about the extent of my Valyrian <eos>
 <open-exp> KINVARA says nothing <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Thank you for travelling all this way <eos> I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be <eos>
 <open-exp> TYRION looks at VARYS <eos> KINVARA says nothing <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> The truth is we need your help <eos> We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
 <boname> KINVARA <eoname> You don 't need to persuade me <eos> I came to help <eos>
 <open-exp> KINVARA continues up the steps <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> KINVARA <eoname> Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised <eos> From the fire she was reborn to remake the world <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Yes <eos>
 <boname> KINVARA <eoname> She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> She did indeed <eos>
 <boname> KINVARA <eoname> Her dragons are fire made flesh , a gift from the Lord of Light <eos> But you heard all this before , haven 't you <question> On the Long Bridge of Volantis <eos> The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands , burning their sins and flesh away <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Ideally we 'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers <eos> The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths <eos>
 <boname> KINVARA <eoname> You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed <eos> And while she 's gone , you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> I 'd settle for obeyed <eos>
 <boname> KINVARA <eoname> I will summon my most eloquent priests <eos> They will spread the word <eos> Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> That sounds most excellent --
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses <eos> He , too , had a glorious destiny <eos> He attacked King 's Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me <eos> Last I had heard , he 'd been defeated again , this time at Winterfell and this time for good <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> We 'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> I suppose it 's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake <eos> Isn 't that the whole point of being a fanatic <question> You 're always right <eos> Everything is the Lord 's will <eos>
 <boname> KINVARA <eoname> Everything is the Lord 's will <eos> But men and women make mistakes <eos> Even honest servants of the Lord <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> And you , an honest servant of the lord , why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis <question>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion , but we are all loyal supporters of the queen <eos>
 <open-exp> VARYS nods <eos> KINVARA takes two more steps <eos> She is one step away from TYRION and VARYS <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> KINVARA <eoname> Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason <eos> Terrible things happen for a reason <eos> Take what happened to you , Lord Varys , when you were a child <eos> If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer , you wouldn 't be here helping the Lord 's Chosen bring his light into the world <eos> Knowledge has made you powerful <eos> But there 's still so much you don 't know <eos> Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire <question> You heard a voice call out from the flames <eos> Do you remember <question> Should I tell you what the voice said <question>
 <open-exp> KINVARA approaches VARYS and places her hand on his arm <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> KINVARA <eoname> Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke <question>
 <open-exp> VARYS scrunches up his face and stares at KINVARA <eos> KINVARA smiles <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> KINVARA <eoname> We serve the same queen <eos> If you are her true friend , you have nothing to fear from me <eos>
 <open-exp> KINVARA turns and walks back down the steps <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> BRAN <eoname> What <question>
 <open-exp> BRAN walks towards them , and then among their ranks <eos> They do not react <eos> He inspects several of them as he walks by <eos> On the other side of the army , he finds the Night King and four White Walkers on horseback <eos> The Night King stares at him <eos> BRAN turns around to find the entire army of the undead staring at him <eos> When he turns back around , the Night King is standing right behind him <eos> He recoils , but the Night King grabs his forearm <eos> He screams <eos> <close-exp>

 <open-exp> BRAN screams as he releases the tree root and the vision ends <eos> MEERA jumps to her feet <eos> <close-exp>

 <open-exp> LEAF and another Child of the Forest enter <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRAN <eoname> I don 't know <eos> He was close , but --
 <open-exp> BRAN pulls back his sleeve <eos> There is a handprint on his forearm <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRAN <eoname> But he can 't get in <eos>
 <boname> MEERA <eoname> Come on , Hodor <eos> Help me with the sledge <eos>
 <boname> HODOR <eoname> Hodor <eos>
 <boname> BRAN <eoname> I 'm sorry <eos> I didn 't mean to <eos>

 <open-exp> INT <eos> CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL <close-exp>
 <open-exp> JON SNOW , SANSA , BRIENNE , DOLOROUS EDD , DAVOS , TORMUND , and MELISANDRE are gathered around a table <eos> A map is spread out on the table with tokens indicating houses laid on its surface <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> We can 't defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons <eos> If we want to survive , we need Winterfell , and to take Winterfell , we need more men <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> Aside from the Starks and the Boltons , the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers , the Karstarks , and the Manderlys <eos>
 <open-exp> DAVOS stands and moves some of the tokens to Winterfell <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons , so we 're not doing so well there <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies <eos> They can hang <eos> But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> I beg your pardon , my lady , but they know that a Stark beheaded their father <eos> I don 't think we can count on them either <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> How well do you know the North , Ser Davos <question>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> Precious little , my lady <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> My father always said Northerners are different <eos> More loyal , more suspicious of outsiders <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> They may well be loyal , but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family <question> I may not know the North , but I know men <eos> They 're more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don 't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause <eos> If Jon 's going to convince them to fight alongside him , they need to believe it 's a fight they can win <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover , Mormont , Cerwyn , Mazin , Hornwood <eos> Two dozen more <eos> Together they equal all the others <eos> We can start small and build <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> The North remembers <eos> They remember the Stark name <eos> People will still risk everything for it , from White Harbor to Ramsay 's own door <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> I don 't doubt it <eos> But Jon doesn 't have the Stark name <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> No , but I do <eos>
 <open-exp> JON SNOW stares at SANSA <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark 's son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton 's <eos> Ant there are also the Tullys <eos> They 're not Northern , but they will back us against the Boltons without question <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> I didn 't know the Tullys still had an army <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> How do you know that <question>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> That 's good <eos> The Blackfish is a legend <eos> His support would mean a great deal <eos> Stark , Tully , a few more houses , almost starts to look like a winning side <eos>
 <open-exp> SANSA smiles <eos> <close-exp>

 <open-exp> BRIENNE follows SANSA down the stairs and along a walkway <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> I 've sworn to protect you , my lady <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> You heard them <eos> We need more men and my uncle has an army <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> We can send the Blackfish a raven <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> Can 't risk Ramsay intercepting it <eos> It has to be you <eos>
 <open-exp> BRIENNE and SANSA enter SANSA 's chamber <eos> BRIENNE closes the door behind them <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> Ride for Riverrun <eos> My uncle will talk to you and you 'll know how to talk to him <eos>
 <open-exp> SANSA sits down on her bed <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> What is it <question>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> I don 't like leaving you here alone <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> With Jon <question>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> Not him <eos> He seems trustworthy <eos> A bit brooding , perhaps <eos> I suppose that 's understandable , considering <eos> The others , though <eos> Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic <eos> And when Stannis paid for his crime , where were they <question> Already out looking for a leader with better prospects <eos> And that wildling fellow with the beard --
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> Jon isn 't Tormund <eos> Jon isn 't Davos , the Red Woman , or Stannis for that matter <eos> Jon is Jon <eos> He 's my brother <eos> He 'll keep me safe <eos> I trust him <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun <question>
 <boname> CUT_TO <eoname> CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD
 <open-exp> Several men of the Night 's Watch are readying horses <eos> JON SNOW stands beside them <eos> MELISANDRE sits on her horse behind them <eos> BRIENNE walks past <eos> SANSA approaches JON SNOW , carrying a bundled cloak <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> New dress <question>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> I made it myself <eos> Do you like it <question>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Year , it 's -- I like the wolf bit <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> Good , because I made this for you <eos>
 <open-exp> SANSA hands JON SNOW the cloak <eos> JON SNOW looks at it <eos> The direwolf sigil of House Stark is pressed into the leather straps <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> I made it like the one Father used to wear <eos> As near as I can remember <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Thank you , Sansa <eos>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> You 're welcome <eos>
 <open-exp> SANSA walks away <eos> BRIENNE is sitting on horseback beside TORMUND <eos> TORMUND stares at her <eos> She catches him staring and looks away <eos> He grins <eos> DOLOROUS EDD approaches JON SNOW , who is donning his new cloak <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Don 't knock it down while I 'm gone <eos>
 <boname> DOLOROUS_EDD <eoname> I 'll do my best <eos>
 <open-exp> They embrace <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> DOLOROUS_EDD <eoname> Good luck <eos>
 <open-exp> JON SNOW walks to his horse and climbs atop it <eos> He leads SANSA , MELISANDRE , PODRICK , BRIENNE , TORMUND , and the rest of the party out through the southern gates <eos> A man of the Night 's Watch approaches DOLOROUS EDD , who is watching them leave <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> MAN <eoname> Should we close the gate , Lord Commander <question>

 <boname> TOMMEN <eoname> What about Loras <question>
 <boname> MARGAERY <eoname> I love my brother <eos> I will always love my brother <eos> His soul is pure and perfect <eos> His sins don 't erase that purity , they only obscure it <eos> He just needs to atone for them <eos> We all do <eos> Sooner or later , one way or another <eos> The gods have a plan for us all <eos>

 <boname> BLACK_WALDER <eoname> Yes , father <eos>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> It 's a castle , not a bloody sheep <eos> Presumably you still know where it is <eos> You didn 't lose Riverrun <eos> You let the Blackfish take it from you <eos>
 <boname> LOTHAR <eoname> He surprised us <eos> He knows the castle better than anyone <eos>
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding <eos> You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave <eos> Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him , you couldn 't find him <eos> That 's what it means to lose something <eos> Now he 's come back and taken Riverrun <eos>
 <boname> BLACK_WALDER <eoname> I don 't think it 's fair to blame us- -
 <boname> WALDER <eoname> For 300 years we kissed Tully boots , swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners <eos> Not again <eos> Riverrun is ours <eos> Take it back <eos>
 <boname> BLACK_WALDER <eoname> We don 't have the men <eos>

 <boname> JAIME <eoname> He has our son <exclamation> He stole our son <exclamation> He 's torn our family apart <eos> How should we treat people who tear us apart <question>

 <boname> DIM_DALBA <eoname> We said we 'd fight with you , King Crow , when the time comes and we meant it , but this isn 't what we agreed to <eos> These aren 't White Walkers <eos> This isn 't an army of the dead <eos> This isn 't our find <eos>
 <boname> TORMUND <eoname> If it weren 't for him , none of us would be here <eos> All of you would be meat in the Night King 's army <eos> And I 'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance <eos>
 <boname> DIM_DALBA <eoname> Remember Mance 's camp <question> It stretched all the way to the horizon <eos> And look at us now <eos> Look what 's left of us <eos> And if we lose this , we 're gone <eos> Dozens of tribes , hundreds of generations <eos> Be like we were never there at all <eos> We 'll be the last of the free folk <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> That 's what 'll happen to you if we lose <eos> The Boltons , the Karstarks , the Umbers , they know you 're here <eos> They know that more than half of you are women and children <eos> After they finish with me , they 'll come for you <eos> You 're right <eos> This isn 't your fight <eos> You shouldn 't have to come to Winterfell with me <eos> I shouldn 't be asking you <eos> It 's not the deal we made <eos> I need you with me if we 're gonna beat them , and we need to beat them if you 're going to survive <eos>

 <open-exp> JON SNOW looks at SANSA <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> SANSA <eoname> I remember when you were born , my lady <eos> You were named for my Aunt Lyanna <eos> It was said she was a great beauty <eos> I 'm sure you will be , too <eos>
 <boname> LYANNA <eoname> I doubt it <eos> My mother wasn 't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty <eos> She was a great warrior , though <eos> She died fighting for your brother , Robb <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I served under your uncle at Castle Black , Lady Lyanna <eos> He was also a great warrior and an honorable man <eos> I was his steward <eos> In fact- -
 <boname> LYANNA <eoname> I think we 've had enough small talk <eos> What are you here <question>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed <eos> He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men <eos> It said- -
 <boname> LYANNA <eoname> I remember what it said <eos> <boquote>Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark <eos><eoquote>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Robb is gone , but House Stark is not <eos> And it needs your support now more than ever <eos> I 've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont 's allegiance <eos>

 <boname> SANSA <eoname> I did what I had to do to survive , my lady <eos> But I am a Stark <eos> I will always be a Stark <eos>
 <boname> LYANNA <eoname> If you say so <eos> In any case , you don 't just want my allegiance <eos> You want my fighting men <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell , my lady <eos> It is our duty to stop him <eos> Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner <eos> What you have to understand , my lady , is that- -

 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> You never thought you 'd find yourself in your position <eos> Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age <eos> I never thought I 'd be in my position <eos> I was a crabber 's son , then I was a smuggler <eos> And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war <eos> But I 'm here because this isn 't someone else 's war <eos> It 's our war <eos>
 <boname> LYANNA <eoname> Go on , Ser Davos <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> Your uncle , Lord Commander Mormont , made that man his steward <eos> He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right , even if it meant giving his life <eos> Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn 't between a few squabbling houses <eos> It 's between the living and the dead <eos> And make no mistake , my lady , the dead are coming <eos>
 <boname> LYANNA <eoname> Is this true <question>
 <open-exp> JON SNOW nods <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men <eos> I fought them at Hardhome <eos> We both lost <eos>
 <boname> DAVOS <eoname> As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell , the North is divided <eos> And a divided North won 't stand a chance against the Night King <eos> You want to protect your people , my lady <eos> I understand <eos> But there 's no hiding from this <eos> We have to fight and we need to do it together <eos>

 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> 62 <question>
 <boname> LYANNA <eoname> We are not a large house , but we 're a proud one <eos> And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders <eos>

 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> I choose violence <eos>
 <open-exp> One of the Faith Militant swings his club into GREGOR 's chestplate <eos> GREGOR is unaffected <eos> The club is stuck in the metal of the armor and the Faith Militant man struggles to wrench it free <eos> He pulls it loose and reels back for another swing , but GREGOR takes him by the throat with one hand and lifts him up off the ground <eos> LANCEL and the other Faith Militant regroup in the courtyard <eos> The man in GREGOR 's grasp gasps and drops his club <eos> GREGOR tosses him out into the courtyard , then follows him out <eos> GREGOR kneels over the man , grabs him by the jaw , and rips his head off <eos> LANCEL looks around at the other Faith Militant <eos> CERSEI smiles <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Getting a bit old to be a squire , aren 't we <question>
 <open-exp> BRONN releases PODRICK <eos> PODRICK coughs <eos> BRONN laughs and slaps PODRICK on the shoulder <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Podrick fucking Payne <eos> I thought you 'd be dead by now <eos>

 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> What <question> No <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Why not <question> I 'd fuck her <eos> You 'd fuck her , wouldn 't you <question>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> I 'm her squire <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Oh <eos> Well , he 'd fuck her , that 's for sure <eos> And she 's fuck him , don 't you think <question> The way she looks at him <eos> The way all women look at him is frankly irritating <eos> I preferred working with the little brother on that account <eos> Come on , you 're the one with the magic cock <eos>
 <open-exp> BRONN grabs PODRICK 's crotch <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> You must have shown it to her by now <eos>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> She 's training me to fight <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Is she <question> Oh <eos>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> An hour in the morning , and hour at night <eos> Every day <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you <question>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> Well , that 's a different sort of fighting <eos>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Now , that 's the truth , isn 't it <question> You want to learn that sort of fighting <question>
 <open-exp> PODRICK smiles and nods <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> All right , let 's start with your footwork <eos>
 <open-exp> BRONN stands across from PODRICK <eos> <close-exp>

 <open-exp> PODRICK postures up <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Now , listen to me , Pod <eos> See how your feet are about a yard apart <question>
 <open-exp> PODRICK looks down at his feet <eos> BRONN slaps him across the face <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRONN <eoname> Lesson number one , assume everyone wants to hit you <eos> ‘Cause they do , Pod <eos> Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire <eos> Do it again <eos> Come on , don 't sulk <eos>
 <boname> CUT_TO <eoname> JAIME 'S TENT
 <open-exp> BRIENNE and JAIME stand across from each other <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> I never thought you 'd find her <eos> I just assumed Sansa was dead <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> Why would you assume that <question>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> In my experience , girls like her don 't live very long <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> I don 't think you know many girls like her <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Well , I 'm proud of you <eos> I am <eos> You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds <eos>
 <open-exp> JAIME walks around the room and comes to a stop on BRIENNE 's other side <eos> BRIENNE turns to face him <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Of course my sister wants Sansa dead <eos> The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey 's murder , so there is that complication <eos> What the hell are you doing here <question>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> I 've come for the Blackfish <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> You 're welcome to have him <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell <question>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> The Tully army <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> They 're a bit occupied at the moment <eos> I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels , so you can see the conundrum <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> The Tullys are rebels because they 're fighting for their home <question>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Exactly <eos>
 <open-exp> JAIME and BRIENNE stare at each other <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> We shouldn 't argue about politics <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> You 're a knight , Ser Jaime <eos> I know there is honor in you <eos> I 've seen it myself <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> I 'm a Lannister <eos> Don 't ask me to betray my own house <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> I do no such thing <eos> Take Riverrun without bloodshed <eos> Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> What do you propose <question>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce <eos> Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Why would he abandon his ancestral home <question>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> Because you 'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Have you ever met the Blackfish <question>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> No <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> He 's even more stubborn than you are <eos>
 <open-exp> BRIENNE looks down <eos> JAIME walks back around the table to BRIENNE 's other side <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> All right <eos> Try to talk some sense into the old goat <eos> He won 't listen , but his men might <eos> Not everybody wants to die for someone else 's home <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> I need your word <eos> If I persuade him to abandon the castle , you 'll grant us safe passage north <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> You have my word <eos> You have until nightfall <eos>
 <open-exp> BRIENNE nods and undoes her sword belt <eos> She hands Oathkeeper to JAIME <eos> JAIME sighs <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> You gave it to me for a purpose <eos> I 've achieved that purpose <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> It 's yours <eos> It will always be yours <eos>
 <open-exp> BRIENNE stares into JAIME 's eyes , then ties Oathkeeper back on her waist and begins to walk out <eos> JAIME follows her to the entrance of the tent <eos> BRIENNE turns back <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> one last thing , Ser Jaime <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Yes , Lady Brienne <question>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender , and if you attack the castle , honor compels me to fight for Sansa 's kin <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Of course it does <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> To fight you <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Let 's hope it doesn 't come to that <eos>
 <open-exp> BRIENNE and JAIME stare into each other 's eyes <eos> BRIENNE exits <eos> JAIME watches her go <eos> <close-exp>

 <open-exp> BRIENNE and PODRICK follow BRYNDEN holding a piece of parchment as he walks along the walls of Riverrun <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRYNDEN <eoname> I 've said no three times already <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark <eos>
 <boname> BRYNDEN <eoname> I haven 't seen her since she was a child <eos> I don 't know her signature <eos> I don 't know you <eos> And I will not surrender <eos>
 <open-exp> BRYNDEN turns to one of his soldiers <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRYNDEN <eoname> Double the guards tonight <eos>
 <open-exp> BRYNDEN looks out at the Lannister/Frey encampment <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> BRYNDEL The Kingslayer wants to try us <eos> I can feel it <eos> <close-exp>
 <open-exp> BRYNDEN turns on his heel and walks inside <eos> BRIENNE and PODRICK follow him <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> As I have said , my name is- -
 <boname> BRYNDEN <eoname> Yes , Brienne of Tarth <eos> I know your father <eos> A good man <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> He always spoke highly of you <eos>
 <boname> BRYNDEN <eoname> And if he were here now , I 'd tell him the same I 'm telling you <eos>
 <open-exp> BRYNDEN makes his way down a set of steps <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRYNDEN <eoname> If you think I 'm abandoning my family 's seat on the Kingslayer 's word of honor , you 're a bloody fool <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys <eos>
 <boname> BRYNDEN <eoname> We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can <eos>
 <open-exp> BRYNDEN , BRIENNE , and PODRICK emerge into Riverrun 's main courtyard <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> He 's not my friend <eos>
 <boname> BRYNDEN <eoname> No <question>
 <open-exp> BRYNDEN stops and turns back to face BRIENNE <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRYNDEN <eoname> Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle <question> Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel <question>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark <eos> He sent me to find Sansa , to help her as Catelyn wanted <eos> He gave me this sword to protect her <eos> That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die <eos>
 <open-exp> BRIENNE holds out the piece of parchment to BRYNDEN <eos> BRYNDEN takes it , unfolds it , and reads its contents <eos> He smiles and chuckles under his breath <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRYNDEN <eoname> She 's exactly like her mother <eos>
 <open-exp> BRIENNE smiles <eos> BRYNDEN turns back to face her <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRYNDEN <eoname> I don 't have enough men to help her take Winterfell <eos>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> You have more than she does <eos>
 <boname> BRYNDEN <eoname> She wants her home back <eos> I understand that <eos> But this is my home <eos> And if Jaime Lannister wants it , he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does <eos>
 <open-exp> BRYNDEN hands the letter back to BRIENNE <eos> She takes it <eos> BRYNDEN walks away <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> Find the maester <eos> We need to get a raven north to Sansa <eos>
 <boname> PODRICK <eoname> What should I write <question>
 <boname> BRIENNE <eoname> Tell her I failed <eos>
 <open-exp> INT <eos> RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM <close-exp>
 <open-exp> A crowd of nobles fills the throne room <eos> CERSEI enters , followed by QYBURN and GREGOR <eos> The crowd stares at them and parts to let them pass <eos> They approach the throne <eos> TOMMEN , KEVAN , and MAESTER PYCELLE stand atop the steps to the throne <eos> KEVAN walks down the steps and confronts CERSEI <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> There 's to be a royal announcement <question>
 <boname> KEVAN <eoname> There is <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> Why wasn 't I informed <question>
 <boname> KEVAN <eoname> There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment <eos>

 <boname> TOMMEN <eoname> Lords and ladies , the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world <eos> One collapses , so does the other <eos> The Father judges us all <eos> If you break his laws <eos> <eos> <eos>you will be punished <eos> After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon , we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister 's trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother <eos>
 <open-exp> Members of the crowd murmur to one another <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TOMMEN <eoname> Furthermore , after much prayer and reflection , the Crown has decided that from this day forward , trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms <eos> The tradition is a brutish one , a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods <eos> Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith <eos> Seven blessings to all <eos>
 <boname> CROWD <eoname> Seven blessings <eos>
 <open-exp> TOMMEN stands and makes his way out of the hall , accompanied by the goldcloaks <eos> CERSEI watches him leave <eos> QYBURN walks up beside CERSEi and whispers to her <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> QYBURN <eoname> Your Grace <eos> <eos> <eos>that old rumor you told me about <eos> My little birds investigated <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI <eoname> And <question> Was it just a rumor or something more <question>

 <boname> MISSANDEI <eoname> I have tried wine before <eos> It made me feel funny <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> That 's how you know it 's working <eos>

 <open-exp> MISSANDEI sips her wine <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> <eos> <eos> <eos>but when the barkeep brings them over , each of them finds a fly in his cup <eos> The Lannister , outraged , shoves the cup aside and demands another <eos> The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole <eos> The Stark reaches into his cup , pulls out the fly and shouts , <boquote>Spit it out , you see shit <eos> Spit it out <eos><eoquote>
 <open-exp> GREY WORM and MISSANDEI do not laugh <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> It 's funnier in Westeros <eos>
 <boname> GREY_WORM <eoname> The Starks and the lannisters , i thought these were enemies <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> Yes <eos>
 <boname> MISSANDEI <eoname> A joke is like a story , Torgo Nudho <eos> Not a true story , necessarily <eos>
 <boname> TYRION <eoname> A story that 's supposed to make you laugh , ideally <eos> Not at the moment , perhaps <eos>
 <open-exp> MISSANDEI sips her wine again <eos> <close-exp>

 <boname> EDMURE <eoname> Oh , good <eos> Good , that 's- - that 's a fine thing <eos> My uncle will never surrender the castle , ser <eos> Whatever game you 're playing <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> The Blackfish is an old man <eos> A good death is all he can hope for <eos> But you , you have a child now , I 've heard <eos> A son you sired on your wedding night <eos> You 're a potent man <eos>
 <boname> EDMURE <eoname> A son I 've never met born of a wife that I haven 't seen since our first night together <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> You should be with them both <eos> I can arrange that , you realize <question> Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock <eos> A tutor for your boy , knights to train him to fight and to ride <eos> And when he comes of age , he 'll have a keep of his own <eos>
 <boname> EDMURE <eoname> Do you imagine yourself a decent person <question> Is that it <question> After you 've massacred my family <eos> Kept me in a cell for years <eos> Stolen our lands <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> I 'll remind you that our houses are at war <eos> I 'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you , but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences <eos>
 <boname> EDMURE <eoname> Says the man who shoved his sword through his king 's back <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation <question> It 's not <eos>
 <open-exp> JAIME sits on a barrel in the corner of the room <eos> <close-exp>

 <open-exp> EDMURE laughs <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> EDMURE <eoname> Yeah <eos> She should have killed you <eos>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> Perhaps , but she didn 't <eos> Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me <eos> But I didn 't hate her <eos> I admired her <eos> Far more than her husband or her son <eos>
 <boname> EDMURE <eoname> Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don 't <question>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> No , I don 't , but I 'm telling you anyway because you 're my prisoner <eos> You don 't have a choice <eos> The love she had for her children , I was a little awed by it <eos> Reminded me of my sister <eos>
 <boname> EDMURE <eoname> Oh <eos> Oh , I see <eos> You 're a madman <eos>

 <boname> JAIME <eoname> That 's exactly why I came here <eos> I love Cersei <eos> You can laugh at that if you want <eos> You can sneer <eos> It doesn 't matter <eos> She needs me <eos> And to get back to her , I have to take Riverrun <eos> I 'll send for your baby boy <eos>
 <open-exp> EDMURE struggles against his bindings , pushing himself towards JAIME <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JAIME <eoname> And I 'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult <eos> Because you don 't matter to me , Lord Edmure <eos> Your son doesn 't matter to me <eos> The people in the castle don 't matter to me <eos> Only Cersei <eos> And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her , that 's what I 'll do <eos>
