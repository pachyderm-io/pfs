 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I wish I could be here when you wake up <eos> I 'm going north with Uncle Benjen <eos> I 'm taking the black <eos> I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together , but you 'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you 're better <eos> I 'll know my way around by then <eos> I 'll be a sworn brother of the Night 's Watch <eos> We can go out walking beyond the Wall , if you 're not afraid <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> I want you to leave <eos>
 <open-exp> Eddard walks into the room , Jon kisses Brandon on the forehead and exits <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon <eos> You came back a year later with another woman 's son <eos> And now you 're leaving again <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I have no choice <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> That 's what men always say when honor calls <eos> That 's what you tell your families , tell yourselves <eos> You do have a choice <eos> And you 've made it <eos> I can 't do it , Ned <eos> I really can 't <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You can <eos> You must <eos>

 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> My mother <question>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> She was very kind <eos>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> Good <eos> Next time I see you , you 'll be all in black <eos>

 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Gods , this is country <exclamation> I 've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I 've half a mind to go with you <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> What do you say , just you and me on the Kingsroad , swords at our sides , a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You should have asked me 20 years ago <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> There were wars to fight , women to marry <eos> <eos> <eos> We never had the chance to be young <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I recall a few chances <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> There was that one <eos> <eos> <eos> Oh , what was her name <question> That common girl of yours <question> Becca <question> With the great big tits you could bury your face in <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Bessie <eos> She was one of yours <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Bessie <exclamation> Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits <eos> Yours was <eos> <eos> <eos> Aleena <question> No <eos> You told me once <eos> Meryl <question> Your bastard 's mother <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Wylla <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> That 's it <eos> She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor <eos> You never told me what she looked like <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Nor will I <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> We were at war <eos> None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again <eos> You 're too hard on yourself <eos> You always have been <eos> I swear if I weren 't your King , you 'd have hit me already <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> The worst thing about your coronation <eos> <eos> <eos> I 'll never get to hit you again <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Trust me , that 's not the worst thing <eos> There was a rider in the night <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord <eos> What of it <question> Should we send her a wedding gift <question>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> A knife perhaps , a good sharp one , and a bold man to wield it <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> She 's little more than a child <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Tell me we 're not speaking of this <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Oh , it 's unspeakable to you <question> What her father did to your family <eos> <eos> <eos> That was unspeakable <eos> What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister <eos> <eos> <eos> the woman I loved <eos> I 'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> But you can 't get your hands on this one , can you <question>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> This Khal Drogo , it 's said he has 100 , 000 men in his horde <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm , as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea <eos> They have no ships , Robert <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper <eos> If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back , the scum will join him <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> He will not cross <eos> And if by chance he does , we 'll throw him back into the sea <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> There 's a war coming , Ned <eos> I don 't know when , I don 't know who we 'll be fighting , but it 's coming <eos>

 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Rapers <eos> They were given a choice no doubt <eos> <eos> <eos> Castration or the Wall <eos> Most choose the knife <eos> Not impressed by your new brothers <question> Lovely thing about the Watch <eos> <eos> <eos> You discard your old family and get a whole new one <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Why do you read so much <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Look at me and tell me what you see <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Is this a trick <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> What you see is a dwarf <eos> If I 'd been born a peasant they might 've left me out in the woods to die <eos> Alas , I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock <eos> Things are expected of me <eos> My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Until your brother killed that King <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Yes , until my brother killed him <eos> Life is full of these little ironies <eos> My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him <eos> I must do my part for the honor of my house , wouldn 't you agree <question> But how <question> Well , my brother has his sword and I have my mind <eos> And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone <eos> That 's why I read so much <eos> And you <question> What 's your story , bastard <question>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Ask me nicely and maybe I 'll tell you , dwarf <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> A bastard boy with nothing to inherit , off to join the ancient order of the Night 's Watch , alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> The Night 's Watch protects the realm from <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Yes yes , against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about <eos> You 're a smart boy <eos> You don 't believe that nonsense <eos> <eos> <eos> Everything 's better with some wine in the belly <eos>

 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Everywhere <question> Even in the east <question>
 <boname> IRRI <eoname> No dragon <eos> Brave men kill them <eos> It is known <eos>
 <boname> JHIQUI <eoname> It is known <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> The moon <question>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> He told me the moon was an egg , Khaleesi , that once there were two moons in the sky <eos> But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat <eos> Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun 's fire <eos>
 <boname> IRRI <eoname> Moon is no egg <eos> Moon is goddess <eos> <eos> <eos> wife of sun <eos> It is known <eos>
 <boname> JHIQUI <eoname> It is known <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Leave me with her <eos> Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories <question>
 <open-exp> Irri leaves the tent <eos> <close-exp>

 <open-exp> Catelyn holds council in the Godswood with Robb , Theon Greyjoy , Rodrick and Maester Luwin <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> What I am about to tell you must remain between us <eos> I don 't think Bran fell from that tower <eos> I think he was thrown <eos>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> The boy was always sure-footed before <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> Someone tried to kill him twice <eos> Why <question> Why murder an innocent child <question> Unless he saw something he wasn 't meant to see <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Saw what , my lady <question>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> I don 't know <eos> But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved <eos> We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown <eos>
 <boname> RODRICK_CASSEL <eoname> Did you notice the dagger the killer used <question> It 's too fine a weapon for such a man <eos> The blade is Valyrian steel , the handle dragonbone <eos> Someone gave it to him <eos>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> They come into our home and try to murder my brother <question> If it 's war they want <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> If it comes to that , you know I 'll stand behind you <eos>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> What , is there going to be a battle in the Godswood <question> Too easily words of war become acts of war <eos> We don 't know the truth yet <eos> Lord Stark must be told of this <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> I don 't trust a raven to carry these words <eos>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> I 'll ride to King 's Landing <eos>

 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> Mother , you can 't <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> I must <eos>
 <boname> RODRICK_CASSEL <eoname> I 'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you <eos>
 <boname> CATELYN_STARK <eoname> Too large a party attracts unwanted attention <eos> I don 't want the Lannisters to know I 'm coming <eos>
 <boname> RODRICK_CASSEL <eoname> Let me accompany you at least <eos> The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone <eos>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> What about Bran <question>

 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia <eos> Magisters sold their palaces <eos> Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours <eos> They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Well , she sounds like an interesting woman <eos> I don 't think that Drogo will like it with me on top <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> You will make him like it , Khaleesi <eos> Men want what they 've never had <eos> And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch <eos> Are you a slave , Khaleesi <question> Then don 't make love like a slave <eos> Very good , Khaleesi <eos> Out there he is the mighty Khal , but in this tent , he belongs to you <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> I don 't think that this is the Dothraki way <eos>
