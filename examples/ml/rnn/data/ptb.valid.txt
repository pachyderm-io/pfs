 <open-exp> The King , Eddard and the rest of the posse have arrived at King 's Landing <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Get the girls settled in <eos> I 'll be back in time for supper <eos> And , Jory , you go with them <eos>
 <boname> JORY_CASSEL <eoname> Yes , my Lord <eos>
 <open-exp> Ned Stark gives the guard a blank stare before taking off his gloves , the guard realizes Ned 's disinterest and the two begin walking to the council chamber <eos> First they walk through the Great Hall , where the throne sits <eos> Jaime Lannister is lingering in front of the throne <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> Thank the gods you 're here , Stark <eos> About time we had some stern northern leadership <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Glad to see you 're protecting the throne <eos>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> Sturdy old thing <eos> How many kings ' asses have polished it , I wonder <question> What 's the line <question> The King shits and the Hand wipes <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Very handsome armor <eos> Not a scratch on it <eos>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> I know <eos> People have been swinging at me for years , but they always seem to miss <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You 've chosen your opponents wisely then <eos>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> I have a knack for it <eos> It must be strange for you coming into this room <eos> I was standing right here when it happened <eos> He was very brave , your brother <eos> Your father too <eos> They didn 't deserve to die like that <eos> Nobody deserves to die like that <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> But you just stood there and watched <eos>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> 500 men just stood there and watched <eos> All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms <eos> You think anyone said a word , lifted a finger <question> No , Lord Stark <eos> 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt <eos> Except for the screams , of course , and the Mad King laughing <eos> And later <eos> <eos> <eos> When I watched the Mad King die , I remembered him laughing as your father burned <eos> <eos> <eos> It felt like justice <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Is that what you tell yourself at night <question> You 're a servant of justice <question> That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen 's back <question>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> Tell me <eos> <eos> <eos> If I 'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back , would you admire me more <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You served him well , when serving was safe <eos>

 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Lord Stark <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Lord Varys <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad <eos> We are all praying for Prince Joffrey 's full recovery <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> A shame you didn 't say a prayer for the butcher 's son <eos> Renly <exclamation> You 're looking well <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> And you look tired from the road <eos> I told them this meeting could wait another day , but <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> But we have a Kingdom to look after <eos> I 've hoped to meet you for some time , Lord Stark <eos> No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> She has , Lord Baelish <eos> I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> All too well <eos> I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> It wasn 't the man that I chose , my Lord <eos> It was Catelyn Tully <eos> A woman worth fighting for , I 'm sure you 'll agree <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> I humbly beg your pardon , my Lord Stark <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Grand Maester <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> How many years has it been <question> You were a young man <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> And you served another King <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> How forgetful of me <eos> This belongs to you , now <eos> Should we begin <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Without the King <question>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> Winter may be coming , but I 'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> His Grace has many cares <eos> He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> We are the lords of small matters here <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark 's appointment as Hand of the King <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Mmm , how much <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> 40 , 000 gold dragons to the champion , 20 , 000 to the runner-up , 20 , 000 to the winning archer <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Can the treasury bear such expense <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> I 'll have to borrow it <eos> The Lannisters will accommodate , I expect <eos> We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold <eos> What 's another 80 , 000 <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> I 'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> How could you let this happen <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> The Master of Coin finds the money <eos> The King and the Hand spend it <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice , but I fear His Grace doesn 't always listen <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> "Counting coppers , " he calls it <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I 'll speak to him tomorrow <eos> This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> As you will <eos> But still , we 'd best make our plans <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> There will be no plans until I speak to Robert <eos> Forgive me , my Lords <eos> I had a long ride <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> You are the King 's Hand , Lord Stark , we serve at your pleasure <eos>

 <open-exp> Cersei tending to Joffrey 's <boquote>wound<eoquote> <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> Please , it 's nearly healed <eos>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> It 's ugly <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> A King should have scars , you fought off a direwolf <eos> You 're a warrior like your father <eos>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> I 'm not like him <eos> I didn 't fight off anything <eos> It bit me and all I did was scream <eos> And the two Stark girls saw it , both of them <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> That 's not true <eos> You killed the beast <eos> You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father <eos> When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne , your father was a rebel and a traitor <eos> Someday you 'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it <eos>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> Do I have to marry her <question>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> Yes <eos> She 's very beautiful and young <eos> If you don 't like her , you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes , to make little princes and princesses <eos> And if you 'd rather fuck painted whores , you 'll fuck painted whores <eos> And if you 'd rather lie with noble virgins , so be it <eos> You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be <eos> Do something nice for the Stark girl <eos>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> I don 't want to <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> No , but you will <eos> The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road <eos>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> We allow the northerners too much power <eos> They consider themselves our equals <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> How would you handle them <question>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> I 'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10 , 000 men to the royal army <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> A royal army <question>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> Why should every lord command his own men <question> It 's primitive , no better than the hill tribes <eos> We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown , trained by experienced soldiers <eos> <eos> <eos> Instead of a mob of peasants who 've never held pikes in their lives <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> And if the northerners rebel <question>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> I 'd crush them <eos> Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North <eos> Uncle Kevan , maybe <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> And these 10 , 000 northern troops , would they fight for you or their lord <question>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> For me <eos> I 'm their King <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> But you 've just invaded their homeland , asked them to kill their brothers <eos>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> I 'm not asking <eos>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> The North cannot be held <eos> <eos> <eos> not by an outsider <eos> It 's too big and too wild <eos> When the winter comes , the Seven gods together couldn 't save you and your royal army <eos> A good King knows when to save his strength <eos> <eos> <eos> And when to destroy his enemies <eos>
 <boname> JOFFREY_BARATHEON <eoname> So you agree <eos> <eos> <eos> The Starks are enemies <question>
 <boname> CERSEI_BARATHEON <eoname> Everyone who isn 't us is an enemy <eos>

 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> No , sweet girl <eos> You didn 't kill the butcher 's boy <eos>
 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> I hate them <exclamation> I hate all of them <eos> The Hound , the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa <eos>

 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Darling , listen to me <eos> Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday <eos> She cannot betray him <eos> She must take his side even when he 's wrong <eos>

 <boname> OLD_NAN <eoname> Oh , my sweet summer child <eos> What do you know about fear <question> Fear is for the winter , when the snows fall a hundred feet deep <eos> Fear is for the long night , when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness <eos> That is the time for fear , my little Lord , when the White Walkers move through the woods <eos> Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation <eos> Kings froze to death in their castles , same as the shepherds in their huts <eos> And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve , and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks <eos> So is this the sort of story that you like <question> In that darkness , the White Walkers came for the first time <eos> They swept through cities and kingdoms , riding their dead horses , hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds<ellipsis>

 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him <eos> The only man who could say otherwise has no throat , thanks to your boy 's wolf <eos>

 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> Lance through the heart <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Quick one <eos> Lucky for you <eos> Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall <eos> My horse took an arrow so I was on foot , slogging through the mud <eos> He came running at me , this dumb high-born lad , thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword <eos> I knocked him down with the hammer <eos> Gods , I was strong then <eos> Caved in his breastplate <eos> Probably shattered every rib he had <eos> Stood over him , hammer in the air <eos> Right before I brought it down he shouted , "Wait <exclamation> Wait <exclamation>" <eos> <eos> <eos> They never tell you how they all shit themselves <eos> They don 't put that part in the songs <eos> Stupid boy <eos> Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else <eos> He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable , his sons would be ingrates , and he 'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl <eos> Wine <exclamation> Lancel <eos> Gods , what a stupid name <eos> Lancel Lannister <eos> Who named you <question> Some halfwit with a stutter <question> What are you doing <question>

 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood <eos>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> I was there that day <eos> You were only a squire , 16 years old <eos>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte <eos> Best move I ever saw <eos>
 <boname> BARRISTAN_SELMY <eoname> A good fighter , Toyne , but he lacked stamina <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> Your outlaw <eos> <eos> <eos> Any last words <question>
 <boname> JAIME_LANNISTER <eoname> I cut his head off , so no <eos>
 <boname> ROBERT_BARATHEON <eoname> What about Aerys Targaryen <question> What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back <question> I never asked <eos> Did he call you a traitor <question> Did he plead for a reprieve <question>

 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching , you have two choices pay tribute or fight <eos> An easy choice for most <eos> Of course , sometimes it 's not enough <eos> Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he 's given <eos> He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly <eos> Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven 't had a good fight in months and need the practice <eos>

 <boname> BENJEN_STARK <eoname> I hope we 've provided you with some good stories to tell when you 're back in King 's Landing <eos> But something to think about while you 're drinking your wine down there , enjoying your brothels <eos> <eos> <eos> Half the boys you 've seen training will die north of the Wall <eos> Might be a wilding 's axe that gets them , might be sickness , might just be the cold <eos> They die in pain <eos> And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Do you think I 'm plump <question> Listen , Benjen <eos> <eos> <eos> May I call you Benjen <question>
 <boname> BENJEN_STARK <eoname> Call me what you like <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> I 'm not sure what I 've done to offend you <eos> I have great admiration for the Night 's Watch <eos> I 've great admiration for you as First Ranger <eos>
 <boname> BENJEN_STARK <eoname> You know , my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word "but" really counts <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> But <eos> <eos> <eos> I don 't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall <eos> I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up , our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it <eos>
 <boname> BENJEN_STARK <eoname> You 're right <eos> The wildlings are no different from us <eos> A little rougher maybe <eos> But they 're made of meat and bone <eos> I know how to track them and I know how to kill them <eos> It 's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights <eos> You 've never been north of the Wall , so don 't tell me what 's out there <eos>
 <boname> YOREN <eoname> Are you going below <question> Keep well , keep warm <eos>
 <boname> BENJEN_STARK <eoname> Enjoy the capital , brother <eos>

 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> So you 're heading down to King 's Landing too <eos>
 <boname> YOREN <eoname> Day after tomorrow <eos> I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Let 's share the road <eos> I could use some decent company <eos>

 <boname> MAESTER_AEMON <eoname> This summer has lasted nine <eos> But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter <eos> The Starks are always right eventually winter is coming <eos> This one will be long and dark things will come with it <eos>

 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> Any man of the Night 's Watch is welcome at Winterfell <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Any man of the Night 's Watch , but not I , eh , boy <question>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> I 'm not your boy , Lannister <eos> I 'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Then you might learn a lord 's courtesy <eos>
 <open-exp> Hodor enters carrying Bran <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> So it 's true <eos> Hello Bran <eos> Do you remember anything about what happened <question>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> He has no memory of that day <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Curious <eos>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> Why are you here <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel <question> My neck is beginning to hurt <eos>
 <boname> BRAN_STARK <eoname> Kneel , Hodor <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Do you like to ride , Bran <question>
 <boname> BRAN_STARK <eoname> Yes <eos> Well , I mean I did like to <eos>
 <boname> MAESTER_LUWIN <eoname> The boy has lost the use of his legs <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> What of it <question> With the right horse and saddle , even a cripple can ride <eos>
 <boname> BRAN_STARK <eoname> I 'm not a cripple <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Then I 'm not a dwarf <eos> My father will rejoice to hear it <eos> I have a gift for you <eos> Give that to your saddler <eos> He 'll provide the rest <eos> You must shape the horse to the rider <eos> Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy 's voice <eos>
 <boname> BRAN_STARK <eoname> Will I really be able to ride <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> You will <eos> On horseback you will be as tall as any of them <eos>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> Is this some kind of trick <question> Why do you want to help him <question>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples , bastards and broken things <eos>
 <boname> ROBB_STARK <eoname> You 've done my brother a kindness <eos> The hospitality of Winterfell is yours <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Spare me your false courtesies , Lord Stark <eos> There 's a brothel outside your walls <eos> There I 'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier <eos>
 <open-exp> Before Tyrion exits Winterfell for the brothel , Theon sees him off in the courtyard <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Couldn 't resist some northern ass <question> If you like redheads , ask for Ros <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Come to see me off , Greyjoy <question> Kind of you <eos> Your master doesn 't seem to like Lannisters <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> He 's not my master <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> No , of course not <eos> What happened here <question> Where is lady Stark <question> Why didn 't she receive me <question>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> She wasn 't feeling well <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> She 's not in Winterfell , is she <question> Where did she go <question>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> My lady 's whereabouts <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> My lady <question> Your loyalty to your captors is touching <eos> Tell me , how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey <question> I still remember seeing my father 's fleet burn in Lannisport <eos> I believe your uncles were responsible <question>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Must have been a pretty sight <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive <eos> Yes , a great victory for your people <eos> Shame how it all turned out <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> We were outnumbered 10 to one <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> A stupid rebellion then <eos> I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle <eos> Now here you are , your enemy 's squire <eos>
 <boname> THEON_GREYJOY <eoname> Careful , Imp <eos>
 <boname> TYRION_LANNISTER <eoname> I 've offended you <eos> Forgive me , it 's been a rough morning <eos> Anyway , don 't despair <eos> I 'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I 've learned to live with it <eos> Your next tumble with Ros is on me <eos> I 'll try not to wear her out <eos>

 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> These are my people now <eos> You shouldn 't call them savages <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> I 'll call them what I like , because they 're my people <eos> This is my army <eos> Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army <eos>
 <boname> DAENERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> If my brother was given an army of Dothraki , could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms <question>
 <boname> JORAH_MORMONT <eoname> The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea <eos> They fear any water their horses can 't drink <eos>

 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> Your Grace <question>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Yes , my dear <question>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> They call you the last dragon <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> They do <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> You have dragon 's blood in your veins <question>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> It 's entirely possible <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> What happened to the dragons <question> I was told that brave men killed them all <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> The brave men didn 't kill dragons <eos> The brave men rode them <eos> Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen <eos> The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne , which the Usurper is keeping warm for me <eos> The swords of the vanquished , a thousand of them <eos> <eos> <eos> melted together like so many candles <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> I have always wanted to see a dragon <eos> There is nothing in the world that I would rather see <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Really <question> Why dragons <question>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> They can fly <eos> And wherever they are , just a few flaps of their wings and they 're somewhere else <eos> <eos> <eos> Far away <eos> And they can kill <eos> Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing <eos> <eos> <eos> melted <eos> <eos> <eos> like so many candles <eos> Seeing a dragon would make me very happy <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Well , after 15 years in a pleasure house , I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> I was not locked in <eos> I have seen things <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> What have you seen <question>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> I 've seen <eos> <eos> <eos> A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass <eos> I 've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes <eos> And I 've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk <eos> So <eos> <eos> <eos> Have you seen one <question>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> A pirate ship <question>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> A dragon <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> No , the last one died many years before I was born <eos> I 'll tell you what I have seen their skulls <eos> They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep <eos> When I was very young , just 3 or 4 , my father used to walk me down the rows and I 'd recite their names for him <eos> When I got them all right , he 'd give me a sweet <eos> The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong <eos> Skulls no bigger than dog skulls <eos> But as you got closer to the Iron Throne <eos> <eos> <eos> They got bigger and bigger and bigger <eos> There was Ghiscar and Valryon , Vermithrax , Essovius , Archonel , Meraxes , Vhagar <eos> <eos> <eos> And Balerion the Dread <eos> <eos> <eos> whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> What happened to the skulls <question>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> I don 't know <eos> The Usurper had them smashed to powder , I expect <eos> Scattered to the wind <eos>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> That 's very sad <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> Yes , it is <eos> What did I buy you for <question> To make me sad <question>
 <boname> DOREAH <eoname> No , your Grace <eos> To teach your sister <eos>
 <boname> VISERYS_TARGARYEN <eoname> To teach my sister how to be a better lover <question> You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy <question> You pretty little idiot <eos> Go on then <eos> Get on with it <eos>

 <boname> SEPTA_MORDANE <eoname> I wouldn 't worry about that <eos>
 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> Jeyne Poole 's mother had five children , all of them girls <eos>
 <boname> SEPTA_MORDANE <eoname> Yes , but it 's highly unlikely <eos>

 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> And everyone would hate me <eos>
 <boname> SEPTA_MORDANE <eoname> Nobody could ever hate you <eos>
 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> Joffrey does <eos>
 <boname> SEPTA_MORDANE <eoname> Nonsense <eos> Why would you say such a thing <question> That business with the wolves <question> I 've told you a hundred times <eos> <eos> <eos> A direwolf is not <eos> <eos> <eos>

 <boname> JANOS_SLYNT <eoname> It 's the Hand 's tournament that 's causing all this trouble , my Lords <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> The King 's tournament <eos> I assure you the Hand wants no part of it <eos>
 <boname> JANOS_SLYNT <eoname> Call it what you will , Lord Stark Ser , the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day <eos> Last night we had a tavern riot , a brothel fire , three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> Dreadful <eos>
 <boname> RENLY_BARATHEON <eoname> If you can 't keep the King 's peace , perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can <eos>
 <boname> JANOS_SLYNT <eoname> I need more men <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You 'll get 50 <eos> Lord Baelish will see it paid for <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> I will <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> You found money for a champion 's purse , you can find money to keep the peace <eos> I 'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left <eos>
 <boname> JANOS_SLYNT <eoname> Thank you , my Lord Hand Ser <eos> They will be put to good use <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> The sooner this is over , the better <eos>
 <boname> VARYS <eoname> The realm prospers from such events , my Lord <eos> They give the great a chance at glory , and the lowly a respite from their woes <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I 'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket <eos> Now <eos> <eos> <eos> If there 's nothing else , my Lords <question>

 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> This heat <eos> On days like this , I envy you northerners your summer snows <eos> Until tomorrow my Lord <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I 've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Lord Arryn <question> His death was a great sadness to all of us <eos> I took personal charge of his care , but I could not save him <eos> His sickness struck him very hard and very fast <eos> I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed <eos> Lord Jon often came to me for counsel <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Why <question>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> I have been Grand Maester for many years <eos> Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> What did Jon want the night before he died <question>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> He came inquiring after a book <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> A book <question> What book <question>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> I fear it would be of little interest to you , my Lord <eos> A ponderous tome <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I 'd like to read it <eos>
 <open-exp> Now in Pycelle 's room , he hands a book to Ned <eos> <close-exp>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> "The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms , with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children <eos>"
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> "Harkon Umber , first of his name , born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon 's landing , at the last hearth <eos> Blue of eye , brown of hair and fair complected , died in his 14th year of a wound sustained
 <open-exp> in a bear hunt <eos>" <close-exp>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> As I said , my Lord , a ponderous read <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it <question>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> He did not , my Lord <eos> And I did not presume to ask <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Jon 's death <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Such a tragedy <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Did he say anything to you during his final hours <question>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Nothing of import , my Lord <eos> There was one phrase he kept repeating "The seed is strong , " I think it was <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> "The seed is strong" <question> What does that mean <question>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> The dying mind is a demented mind , Lord Stark <eos> For all the weight they 're given , last words are usually as significant as first words <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> And you 're quite certain he died of a natural illness <question>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> What else could it be <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Poison <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> A disturbing thought <eos> I don 't think it likely <eos> The Hand was loved by all <eos> What sort of man would dare <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I 've heard it said that poison is a woman 's weapon <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Yes <eos> Women , cravens <eos> <eos> <eos> and eunuchs <eos> Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Everybody knows that <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> Yes , yes , of course <eos> How that sort of person found himself on the King 's Council , I will never know <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> I 've taken enough of your time <eos>
 <boname> GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE <eoname> No trouble at all , my Lord <eos> It 's a great honor <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Thank you <eos> I 'll find my own way out <eos>

 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> He wants to be a knight of the King 's Guard <eos> He can 't be one now , can he <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> No <eos> But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King 's Council <eos> Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder <eos>
 <boname> ARYA_STARK <eoname> Can I be Lord of a holdfast <question>

 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> He never stops <eos> Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale <question> Not surprising <eos> Until recently , he was only a squire <eos> <eos> <eos> Jon Arryn 's squire <eos> He was knighted almost immediately after his master 's untimely death <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Knighted for what <question> Why are you telling me this <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> I promised Cat that I 'd help you <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Where is Ser Hugh <question> I 'll speak to him <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> A singularly bad idea <eos> Do you see that boy there <question> One of Varys 's little birds <eos> The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings <eos> Now look there <eos> That one belongs to the Queen <eos> And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book <question>

 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> No <eos> She 's one of mine <eos> Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely <question>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Yes <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> The wiser answer was no , my Lord <eos> Get a message to this paragon of yours <eos> <eos> <eos> Discreetly <eos> Send him to question Ser Hugh <eos> After that , you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city <eos> He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Why <question>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> I have my observers , as I said , and it 's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death <eos>
 <boname> EDDARD_STARK <eoname> Lord Baelish , perhaps I was wrong to distrust you <eos>
 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Distrusting me was the wisest thing you 've done since you climbed off your horse <eos>

 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> It 's silly , isn 't it <question> What , we can 't defend the Wall unless we 're celibate <question> It 's absurd <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I didn 't think you 'd be so upset about it <eos>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> Why not <question> Because I 'm fat <question> But I like girls just as much as you do <eos> They might not like me as much <eos> I 've never <eos> <eos> <eos> been with one <eos> You 've probably had hundreds <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> As a matter of fact , I 'm the same as you <eos>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> I find that hard to believe <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I came very close once <eos> I was alone in a room with a naked girl , but <eos> <eos> <eos>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> You didn 't know where to put it <question>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I know where to put it <eos>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> Was she <eos> <eos> <eos> Old and ugly <question>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Young and gorgeous <eos> A whore named Ros <eos>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> What color hair <question>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> Red <eos>

 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> What 's my name <question>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> Jon Snow <question>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> And why is my surname Snow <question>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> Because <eos> <eos> <eos> You 're a bastard from the north <eos>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I never met my mother <eos> My father wouldn 't even tell me her name <eos> I don 't know if she 's living or dead <eos> I don 't know if she 's a noblewoman or a fisherman 's wife <eos> <eos> <eos> Or a whore <eos> So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes <eos> But I couldn 't do it <eos> Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child , another bastard named Snow <question> It 's not a good life for a child <eos>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> So <eos> <eos> <eos> You didn 't know where to put it <question>
 <boname> ALLISER_THORNE <eoname> Enjoying yourselves <question> You look cold , boys <eos>
 <boname> SAMWELL_TARLY <eoname> It is a bit nippy <eos>
 <boname> ALLISER_THORNE <eoname> A bit nippy , yeah , by the fire , indoors <eos> It 's still summer <eos> Do you boys even remember the last winter <question> How long has it been now <question> What , 10 years <question> I remember <eos> Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell <question> Were there days when you just couldn 't get warm , never mind how many fires your servants built <question>
 <boname> JON_SNOW <eoname> I build my own fires <eos>
 <boname> ALLISER_THORNE <eoname> That 's admirable <eos> I spent six months out there , beyond the Wall during the last winter <eos> It was supposed to be a two-week mission <eos> We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch <eos> So we went out to look for some of his men <eos> <eos> <eos> Capture them , gather some knowledge <eos> The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men <eos> Harder than you 'll ever be <eos> They know their country better than we do <eos> They knew there was a storm coming in <eos> So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass <eos> And we got caught in the open <eos> Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground , roots and all <eos> If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss , you lost a finger to the frost <eos> And all in darkness <eos> You don 't know cold <eos> Neither of you do <eos> The horses died first <eos> We didn 't have enough to feed them , to keep them warm <eos> Eating the horses was easy <eos> But later when we started to fall <eos> <eos> <eos> That wasn 't easy <eos> We should have had a couple of boys like you along , shouldn 't we <question> Soft , fat boys like you <eos> We 'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup <eos> Soon we 'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night 's Watch , but you 'd be fools to believe it <eos> You 're boys still <eos> And come the winter you will die <eos> <eos> <eos> Like flies <eos>

 <boname> PETYR_BAELISH <eoname> Not what you were expecting <question> Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound <question> Lovely little tale of brotherly love <eos> The Hound was just a pup , six years old maybe <eos> Gregor a few years older , already a big lad , already getting a bit of a reputation <eos> Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence <eos> One evening <eos> <eos> <eos> Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire <eos> <eos> <eos> Gregor 's toy , a wooden knight <eos> Gregor never said a word , he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals <eos> Held him there while the boy screamed , while his face melted <eos> There aren 't very many people who know that story <eos>
 <boname> SANSA_STARK <eoname> I won 't tell anyone <eos> I promise <eos>
