# WARNING: In June 2019, node auto-upgrade will be enabled by default for newly created clusters and node pools. To disable it, use the `--no-enable-autoupgrade` flag.
# WARNING: Starting in 1.12, new clusters will have basic authentication disabled by default. Basic authentication can be enabled (or disabled) manually using the `--[no-]enable-basic-auth` flag.
# WARNING: Starting in 1.12, new clusters will not have a client certificate issued. You can manually enable (or disable) the issuance of the client certificate using the `--[no-]issue-client-certificate` flag.
# WARNING: Starting in 1.12, default node pools in new clusters will have their legacy Compute Engine instance metadata endpoints disabled by default. To create a cluster with legacy instance metadata endpoints disabled in the default node pool, run `clusters create` with the flag `--metadata disable-legacy-endpoints=true`.
# WARNING: The Pod address range limits the maximum size of the cluster. Please refer to https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/flexible-pod-cidr to learn how to optimize IP address allocation.
# This will enable the autorepair feature for nodes. Please see https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-auto-repair for more information on node autorepairs.


# By default, GKE clusters have RBAC enabled. To allow 'pachctl deploy' to give the 'pachyderm' service account
# the requisite privileges via clusterrolebindings, you will need to grant *your user account* the privileges
# needed to create those clusterrolebindings.
#
# Note that this command is simple and concise, but gives your user account more privileges than necessary. See
# https://docs.pachyderm.io/en/latest/deployment/rbac.html for the complete list of privileges that the
# pachyderm serviceaccount needs.
