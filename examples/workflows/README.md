# Pachyderm Workflows

In this section we'll provide examples to get users started using two broad categories of workflows we've defined in our documentation.

* [Individual Developer Workflow](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/how-tos/individual-developer-workflow/)
* [Team Development Workflow](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/how-tos/team-developer-workflow/)


The problem that users face is that small decisions made up front 
can have major consequences down the road.
Many times, a data scientist or engineer is presented with set of resources and told, "We use this technology, this is what you must work with."

This README will place the two workflows above in that context,
showing a data scientist how to scale their operations
from the individual contributor 
to the collaborative team 
using simple examples 
of a given technology that they can use as a pattern.


The first example will be GitHub Actions.

## GitHub Actions

Please see [that README](./github-actions/README.md) for its flow.


## Pachyderm IDE

Please see [that README](./pachyderm-ide/README.md) for its flow.
