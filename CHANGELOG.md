## 1.5.1 / 1.5.2

### Bug Fixes

* A pipeline can get stuck after repeated worker failures.  (#2064)
* `pachctl port-forward` can leave a orphaned process after it exits.  (#2098)
* `alpine`-based pipelines fail to load input data.  (#2118)
* Logs are written to the object store even when stats is not enabled, slowing down the pipeline unnecessarily.  (#2119)

### Features / Improvements

* Pipelines now support the “stats” feature.  See the [docs](http://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pipeline_spec.html#enable-stats-optional) for details.  (#1998)
* Pipeline cache size is now configurable.  See the [docs](http://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pipeline_spec.html#cache-size-optional) for details.  (#2033)
* `pachctl update-pipeline` now **only** process new input data with the new code; the old input data is not re-processed.  If it’s desired that all data are re-processed, use the `--reprocess` flag.  See the [docs](http://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fundamentals/updating_pipelines.html) for details.  (#2034)
* Pipeline workers now support “pipelining”, meaning that they start downloading the next datums while processing the current datum, thereby improving overall throughput.  (#2057)
* The `scaleDownThreshold` feature has been improved such that when a pipeline is scaled down, the remaining worker only takes up minimal system resources.  (#2091)

## 1.5.0

### Bug Fixes

* Downstream repos' provenance is not updated properly when `update-pipeline` changes the inputs for a pipeline. (#1958)
* `pachctl version` blocks when pachctl doesn't have Internet connectivity. (#1971)
* `incremental` misbehaves when files are deeply nested. (#1974)
* An `incremental` pipeline blocks if there's provenance among its inputs. (#2002)
* PPS fails to create subsequent pipelines if any pipeline failed to be created. (#2004)
* Pipelines sometimes reprocess datums that have already been processed. (#2008)
* Putting files into open commits fails silently. (#2014)
* Pipelines with inputs that use different branch names fail to create jobs. (#2015)
* `get-logs` returns incomplete logs.  (#2019)

### Features

* You can now use `get-file` and `list-file` on open commits. (#1943)

## 1.4.8

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes bugs that caused us to swamp etcd with traffic.
- Fixes a bug that could cause corruption to in pipeline output.

### Features

- Readds incremental processing mode
- Adds `DiffFile` which is similar in function to `git diff`
- Adds the ability to use cloudfront as a caching layer for additional scalability on aws.
- `DeletePipeline` now allows you to delete the output repos as well.
- `DeletePipeline` and `DeleteRepo` now support a `--all` flag

### Removed Features

- Removes one-off jobs, they were a rarely used feature and the same behavior can be replicated with pipelines

## 1.4.7

### Bug fixes

* [Copy elision](http://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/best_practices.html#shuffling-files) does not work for directories. (#1803)
* Deleting a file in a closed commit fails silently. (#1804)
* Pachyderm has trouble processing large files. (#1819)
* etcd uses an unexpectedly large amount of space. (#1824)
* `pachctl mount` prints lots of benevolent FUSE errors. (#1840)

### New features

* `create-repo` and `create-pipeline` now accept the `--description` flag, which creates the repo/pipeline with a "description" field.  You can then see the description via `inspect-repo/inspect-pipeline`. (#1805)
* Pachyderm now supports garbage collection, i.e. removing data that's no longer referenced anywhere.  See the [docs](http://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/best_practices.html#garbage-collection) for details. (#1826)
* Pachyderm now has GPU support!  See the [docs](http://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/tensorflow_gpu.html) for details. (#1835)
* Most commands in `pachctl` now support the `--raw` flag, which prints the raw JSON data as opposed to pretty-printing.  For instance, `pachctl inspect-pipeline --raw` would print something akin to a pipeline spec. (#1839)
* `pachctl` now supports `delete-commit`, which allows for deleting a commit that's not been finished.  This is useful when you have added the wrong data in a commit and you want to start over.
* The web UI has added a file viewer, which allows for viewing PFS file content in the browser.

## 1.4.6

### Bug fixes

* `get-logs` returns errors along the lines of `Invalid character…`. (#1741)
* etcd is not properly namespaced. (#1751)
* A job might get stuck if it uses `cp -r` with lazy files. (#1757)
* Pachyderm can use a huge amount of memory, especially when it processes a large number of files. (#1762)
* etcd returns `database space exceeded` errors after the cluster has been running for a while. (#1771)
* Jobs crashing might eventually lead to disk space being exhausted. (#1772)
* `port-forward` uses wrong port for UI websocket requests to remote clusters (#1754)
* Pipelines can end up with no running workers when the cluster is under heavy load. (#1788)
* API calls can start returning `context deadline exceeded` when the cluster is under heavy load. (#1796)

### New features / improvements

* Union input: a pipeline can now take the union of inputs, in addition to the cross-product of them.  Note that the old `inputs` field in the pipeline spec has been deprecated in favor of the new `input` field.  See the [pipeline spec](http://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pipeline_spec.html#input-required) for details. (#1665)
* Copy elision: a pipeline that shuffles files can now be made more efficient by simply outputting symlinks to input files.  See the [docs on shuffling files](http://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/best_practices.html#shuffling-files) for details. (#1791)
* `pachctl glob-file`: ever wonder if your glob pattern actually works?  Wonder no more.  You can now use `pachctl glob-file` to see the files that match a given glob pattern. (#1795)
* Workers no longer send/receive data through pachd.  As a result, pachd is a lot more responsive and stable even when there are many ongoing jobs.  (#1742)

## 1.4.5

### Bug fixes

* Fix a bug where pachd may crash after creating/updating a pipeline that has many input commits. (#1678)
* Rules for determining when input data is re-processed are made more intuitive.  Before, if you update a pipeline without updating the `transform`, the input data is not re-processed.  Now, different pipelines or different versions of pipelines always re-process data, even if they have the same `transform`. (#1685)
* Fix several issues with jobs getting stuck. (#1717)
* Fix several issues with lazy pipelines getting stuck. (#1721)
* Fix an issue with Minio deployment that results in job crash loop. (#1723)
* Fix an issue where a job can crash if it outputs a large number of files. (#1724)
* Fix an issue that causes intermittent gRPC errors. (#1727)

### New features

* Pachyderm now ships with a web UI!  To deploy a new Pachyderm cluster with the UI, use `pachctl deploy <arguments> --dashboard`.  To deploy the UI onto an existing cluster, use `pachctl deploy <arguments> --dashboard-only`.  To access the UI, simply `pachctl port-forward`, then go to `localhost:38080`.  Note that the web UI is currently in alpha; expect bugs and significant changes.   
* You can now specify the amount of resources (i.e. CPU & memory) used by Pachyderm and etcd.  See `pachctl deploy --help` for details. (#1676)
* You can now specify the amount of resources (i.e. CPU & memory) used by your pipelines.  See the [pipeline spec](http://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pipeline_spec.html#resource-spec-optional) for details. (#1683)

## 1.4.4

### Bug fixes

* A job can fail to restart when encountering an internal error.
* A deployment with multiple pachd nodes can get stalled jobs.
* `delete-pipeline` is supposed to have the `--delete-jobs` flag but doesn't.
* `delete-pipeline` can fail if there are many jobs in the pipeline.
* `update-pipeline` can fail if the original pipeline has not outputted any commits.
* pachd can crash if etcd is flaky.
* pachd memory can be easily exhausted on GCE deployments.
* If a pipeline is created with multiple input commits already present, all jobs spawn and run in parallel.  After the fix, jobs always run serially.

### Features

* Pachyderm now supports auto-scaling: a pipeline's worker pods can be terminated automatically when the pipeline has been idle for a configurable amount of time.  See the `scaleDownThreshold` field of the [pipeline spec](http://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pipeline_spec.html#scale-down-threshold-optional) for details.
* The processing of a datum can be restarted manually via `restart-datum`.
* Workers' statuses are now exposed through `inspect-job`.
* A job can be stopped manually via `stop-job`.

## 1.4.3

### Bug fixes

* Pipelines with multiple inputs process only a subset of data.
* Workers may fall into a crash loop under certain circumstances. (#1606)

### New features

* `list-job` and `inspect-job` now display a job's progress, i.e. they display the number of datums processed thus far, and the total number of datums.
* `delete-pipeline` now accepts an option (`--delete-jobs`) that deletes all jobs in the pipeline. (#1540)
* Azure deployments now support dynamic provisioning of volumes.

## 1.4.2

### Bug fixes

* Certain network failures may cause a job to be stuck in the `running` state forever.
* A job might get triggered even if one of its inputs is empty.
* Listing or getting files from an empty output commit results in `node "" not found` error.
* Jobs are not labeled as `failure` even when the user code has failed.
* Running jobs do not resume when pachd restarts.
* `put-file --recursive` can fail when there are a large number of files.
* minio-based deployments are broken.

### Features

* `pachctl list-job` and `pachctl inspect-job` now display the number of times each job has restarted.
* `pachctl list-job` now displays the pipeline of a job even if the job hasn't completed.

## 1.4.1

### Bug fixes

* Getting files from GCE results in errors.
* A pipeline that has multiple inputs might place data into the wrong `/pfs` directories.
* `pachctl put-file --split` errors when splitting to a large number of files.
* Pipeline names do not allow underscores.
* `egress` does not work with a pipeline that outputs a large number of files.
* Deleting nonexistent files returns errors.
* A job might try to process datums even if the job has been terminated.
* A job doesn't exit after it has encountered a failure.
* Azure backend returns an error if it writes to an object that already exists.

### New features

* `pachctl get-file` now supports the `--recursive` flag, which can be used to download directories.
* `pachctl get-logs` now outputs unstructured logs by default.  To see structured/annotated logs, use the `--raw` flag.

## 1.4.0

Features/improvements:

- Correct processing of modifications and deletions.  In prior versions, Pachyderm pipelines can only process data additions; data that are removed or modified are effectively ignored.  In 1.4, when certain input data are removed (or modified), downstream pipelines know to remove (or modify) the output that were produced as a result of processing the said input data.

As a consequence of this change, a user can now fix a pipeline that has processed erroneous data by simply making a new commit that fixes the said erroneous data, as opposed to having to create a new pipeline.

- Vastly improved performance for metadata operations (e.g. list-file, inspect-file).  In prior versions, metadata operations on commits that are N levels deep are O(N) in runtime.  In 1.4, metadata operations are always O(1), regardless of the depth of the commit.

- A new way to specify how input data is partitioned.  Instead of using two flags `partition` and `incrementality`, we now use a single `glob` pattern.  See the [glob doc](http://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/pipeline_spec.html#input-glob-pattern) for details.

- Flexible branch management.  In prior versions, branches are fixed, in that a commit always stays on the same branch, and a branch always refers to the same series of commits.  In 1.4, branches are modeled similar to Git's tags; they can be created, deleted, and renamed independently of commits.

- Simplified commit states.  In prior versions, commits can be in many states including `started`, `finished`, `cancelled`, and `archived`.  In particular, `cancelled` and `archived` have confusing semantics that routinely trip up users.  In 1.4, `cancelled` and `archived` have been removed.

- Flexible pipeline updates.  In prior versions, pipeline updates are all-or-nothing.  That is, an updated pipeline either processes all commits from scratch, or it processes only new commits.  In 1.4, it's possible to have the updated pipeline start processing from any given commit.

- Reduced cluster resource consumption.  In prior versions, each Pachyderm job spawns up a Kubernetes job which in turn spawns up N pods, where N is the user-specified parallelism.  In 1.4, all jobs from a pipeline share N pods.  As a result, a cluster running 1.4 will likely spawn up way fewer pods and use fewer resources in total.

- Simplified deployment dependencies.  In prior versions, Pachyderm depends on RethinkDB and etcd to function.  In 1.4, Pachyderm no longer depends on RethinkDB.

- Dynamic volume provisioning.  GCE and AWS users (Azure support is coming soon) no longer have to manually provision persistent volumes for deploying Pachyderm.  `pachctl deploy` is now able to dynamically provision persistent volumes.  See the [deployment doc](http://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/deploy_intro.html) for details.

Removed features:

A handful of APIs have been removed because they no longer make sense in 1.4.  They include:

- ForkCommit (no longer necessary given the new branch APIs)
- ArchiveCommit (the `archived` commit state has been removed)
- ArchiveAll (same as above)
- DeleteCommit (the original implementation of DeleteCommit is very limiting: only open head commits may be removed.  An improved version of DeleteCommit is coming soon)
- SquashCommit (was only necessary due to the way PPS worked in prior versions)
- ReplayCommit (same as above)

## 1.3.0

Features:

- Embedded Applications - Our “service” enhancement allows you to embed applications, like Jupyter, dashboards, etc., within Pachyderm, access versioned data from within the applications, and expose the applications externally.
- Pre-Fetched Input Data - End-to-end performance of typical Pachyderm pipelines will see a many-fold speed up thanks to a prefetch of input data.
- Put Files via Object Store URLs - You can now use “put-file” with s3://, gcs://, and as:// URLS.
- Update your Pipeline code easily - You can now call “create-pipeline” or “update-pipeline” with the “--push-images” flag to re-run your pipeline on the same data with new images.
- Support for all Docker images - It is no longer necessary to include anything Pachyderm specific in your custom Docker images, so use any Docker image you like (with a couple very small caveats discussed below).
- Cloud Deployment with a single command for Amazon / Google / Microsoft / a local cluster - via `pachctl deploy ...`
- Migration support for all Pachyderm data from version `1.2.2` through latest `1.3.0`
- High Availability upgrade to rethink, which is now deployed as a petset
- Upgraded fault tolerance via a new PPS job subscription model
- Removed redundancy in log messages, making logs substantially smaller

1.0.0 is the first generally available release of Pachyderm.
It's a complete rewrite of the 0.* series of releases, sharing no code with them.
The following major architectural changes have happened since 0.*:

- All network communication and serialization is done using protocol buffers and GRPC.
- BTRFS has been removed, instead build on object storage, s3 and GCS are currently supported.
- Everything in Pachyderm is now scheduled on Kubernetes, this includes Pachyderm services and user jobs.
- We now have several access methods, you can use `pachctl` from the command line, our go client within your own code and the FUSE filesystem layer
