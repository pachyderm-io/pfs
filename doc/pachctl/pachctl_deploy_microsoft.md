### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --block-cache-size string     Size of in-memory cache to use for blocks. Size is specified in bytes, with allowed SI suffixes (M, K, G, Mi, Ki, Gi, etc). (default "5G")
      --dry-run                     Don't actually deploy pachyderm to Kubernetes, instead just print the manifest.
