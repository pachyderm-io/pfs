## ./pachctl deploy google

Deploy a Pachyderm cluster running on GCP.

### Synopsis


Deploy a Pachyderm cluster running on GCP.
Arguments are:
  <GCS bucket>: A GCS bucket where Pachyderm will store PFS data.
  <GCE persistent disks>: A comma-separated list of GCE persistent disks, one per etcd node (see --etcd-nodes).
  <size of disks>: Size of GCE persistent disks in GB (assumed to all be the same).


```
./pachctl deploy google <GCS bucket> <size of disk(s) (in GB)>
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --block-cache-size string     Size of in-memory cache to use for blocks. Size is specified in bytes, with allowed SI suffixes (M, K, G, Mi, Ki, Gi, etc). (default "5G")
      --dry-run                     Don't actually deploy pachyderm to Kubernetes, instead just print the manifest.
      --dynamic-etcd-nodes int      Deploy etcd as a StatefulSet with the given number of pods.  The persistent volumes used by these pods are provisioned dynamically.  Note that StatefulSet is currently a beta kubernetes feature, which might be unavailable in older versions of kubernetes.
      --log-level string            The level of log messages to print options are, from least to most verbose: "error", "info", "debug". (default "info")
      --no-metrics                  Don't report user metrics for this command
      --shards int                  Number of Pachd nodes (stateless Pachyderm API servers). (default 16)
      --static-etcd-volume string   Deploy etcd as a ReplicationController with one pod.  The pod uses the given persistent volume.
  -v, --verbose                     Output verbose logs
```
