### Synopsis


Deploy a Pachyderm cluster running on AWS. Arguments are:
  <S3 bucket>: An S3 bucket where Pachyderm will store PFS data.
  <id>, <secret>, <token>: Session token details, used for authorization. You can get these by running 'aws sts get-session-token'
  <region>: The aws region where pachyderm is being deployed (e.g. us-west-1)
  <size of volumes>: Size of EBS volumes, in GB (assumed to all be the same).


```
./pachctl deploy amazon <S3 bucket> <id> <secret> <token> <region> <size of volumes (in GB)>
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --block-cache-size string     Size of in-memory cache to use for blocks. Size is specified in bytes, with allowed SI suffixes (M, K, G, Mi, Ki, Gi, etc). (default "5G")
      --dry-run                     Don't actually deploy pachyderm to Kubernetes, instead just print the manifest.
      --dynamic-etcd-nodes int      Deploy etcd as a StatefulSet with the given number of pods.  The persistent volumes used by these pods are provisioned dynamically.  Note that StatefulSet is currently a beta kubernetes feature, which might be unavailable in older versions of kubernetes.
      --log-level string            The level of log messages to print options are, from least to most verbose: "error", "info", "debug". (default "info")
      --no-metrics                  Don't report user metrics for this command
      --shards int                  Number of Pachd nodes (stateless Pachyderm API servers). (default 16)
      --static-etcd-volume string   Deploy etcd as a ReplicationController with one pod.  The pod uses the given persistent volume.
  -v, --verbose                     Output verbose logs
