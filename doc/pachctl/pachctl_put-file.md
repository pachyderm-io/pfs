## ./pachctl put-file

Put a file into the filesystem.

### Synopsis


Put-file supports a number of ways to insert data into pfs:
```sh
# Put data from stdin as repo/branch/path:
echo "data" | pachctl put-file repo branch path

# Put data from stding as repo/branch/path and start / finish a new commit on the branch.
echo "data" | pachctl put-file -c repo branch path

# Put a file from the local filesystem as repo/branch/path:
pachctl put-file repo branch path -f file

# Put a file from the local filesystem as repo/branch/file:
pachctl put-file repo branch -f file

# Put the contents of a directory as repo/branch/path/dir/file:
pachctl put-file -r repo branch path -f dir

# Put the contents of a directory as repo/branch/dir/file:
pachctl put-file -r repo branch -f dir

# Put the data from a URL as repo/branch/path:
pachctl put-file repo branch path -f http://host/path

# Put the data from a URL as repo/branch/path:
pachctl put-file repo branch -f http://host/path

# Put several files or URLs that are listed in file.
# Files and URLs should be newline delimited.
pachctl put-file repo branch -i file

# Put several files or URLs that are listed at URL.
# NOTE this URL can reference local files, so it could cause you to put sensitive
# files into your Pachyderm cluster.
pachctl put-file repo branch -i http://host/path
```

```
./pachctl put-file repo-name branch path/to/file/in/pfs
```
