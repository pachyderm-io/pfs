## ./pachctl undeploy

Tear down a deployed Pachyderm cluster.

### Synopsis


Tear down a deployed Pachyderm cluster.

```
./pachctl undeploy
```

### Options

```
  -a, --all   
Delete everything, including the persistent volumes where metadata
is stored.  If your persistent volumes were dynamically provisioned (i.e. if
you used the "--dynamic-etcd-nodes" flag), the underlying volumes will be
removed, making metadata such repos, commits, pipelines, and jobs
unrecoverable. If your persistent volume was manually provisioned (i.e. if
you used the "--static-etcd-volume" flag), the underlying volume will not be
removed.
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --no-metrics   Don't report user metrics for this command
  -v, --verbose      Output verbose logs
```
