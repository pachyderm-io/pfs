# Pachyderm Deployment Manifest

When you run the `pachctl deploy` command, Pachyderm generates a JSON-encoded
Kubernetes manifest named `manifest.custom` which consists of sections that
describe a Pachyderm deployment.

Pachyderm deploys the following sets of application components:

- `pachd`: The main Pachyderm pod.
- `etcd`: The administrative datastore for `pachd`.
- `dash`: The web-based UI for Pachyderm Enterprise Edition.

**Example:**

```
pachctl deploy custom --persistent-disk <persistent disk backend> --object-store <object store backend> \
    <persistent disk arg1>  <persistent disk arg 2> \
    <object store arg 1> <object store arg 2>  <object store arg 3>  <object store arg 4> \
    [[--dynamic-etcd-nodes n] | [--static-etcd-volume <volume name>]]
    [optional flags]
```

As you can see in the example command above, you can run the
`pachctl deploy custom` command with different flags that generate
an appropriate manifest for your infrastructure. The flags broadly fall
into the following categories:

| Category               | Description                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--persistent-disk`    | Configures the storage resource for etcd. Pachyderm uses etcd <br> to manage administrative metadata. User data is stored in an   <br> object store, not in etcd. |
| `--object-store`       | Configures the object store that Pachyderm uses for storing all <br> user data that you want to be versioned and managed. |
| Optional flags         | Optional flags that are not required to deploy Pachyderm but <br> enable you to configure access, output format, logging         verbosity, <br>and other parameters. |

## Kubernetes Manifest Parameters

Your Kubernetes manifest includes sections that describe
the configuration of your Pachyderm cluster.

The manifest includes the following sections:

**Roles and permissions manifests**

| Manifest | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `ServiceAccount` | Typically, at the top of the file, a roles and permissions manifest <br> has the `kind` key set to `ServiceAccount`. Kubernetes uses `ServiceAccounts` <br>to assign namespace-specific privileges to applications in a lightweight way. <br>The Pachyderm's service account is called  `pachyderm`. |
| `Role` or `ClusterRole` | Depending on whether you used the `--local-roles` flag or not, <br>the next manifest kind is Role or ClusterRole. |
| `RoleBinding` or <br> `ClusterRoleBinding` | This manifest binds the `Role` or `ClusterRole` to the <br>`ServiceAccount` created above. |

**Application-related manifests**

| Manifest | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `PersistentVolume` | If you used `--static-etcd-volume` to deploy Pachyderm, the <br> value that you specify for `--persistent-disk` causes `pachctl` to write <br> a manifest for creating a `PersistentVolume` that Pachydermâ€™s etcd uses in its <br> `PersistentVolumeClaim`. A common persistent volume that is used in <br>enterprises is an NFS mount backed by a storage fabric. In this case, a <br> `StorageClass` for an NFS mount is made available for consumption. Consult <br> with your Kubernetes administrators to learn what resources are available <br> for your deployment. |
| `PersistentVolumeClaim` | If you deployed Pachyderm by using `--static-etc-volume`, <br> the Pachyderm's `etcd` store uses this `PersistentVolumeClaim`.<br> See this manifest's name in the `etcd` Deployment manifest below. |
| `StorageClass` | If you used the `--dynamic-etcd-nodes` flag to deploy Pachyderm, <br> this manifest specifies the kind of storage and provisioner that <br>is appropriate for what you have specified in the `--persistent-disk` flag. <br> **Note:** You will not see this manifest if you specified `azure` as the argument <br> to `--persistent-disk`. |
| `Service` | In a typical Pachyderm deployment, you see three `Service` manifests.<br> A `Service` is a Kubernetes abstraction that exposes `Pods` to the network. <br> If you use `StatefulSets` to deploy Pachyderm, that is, you used the <br>`--dynamic-etcd-nodes` flag, Pachyderm deploys one `Service` for `etcd-headless`, <br>one for `pachd`, and one for `dash`. A static deployment has `Services` <br> for `etcd`, `pachd`, and `dash`. If you use the `--no-dashboard` flag, <br>Pachyderm does not create a `Service` and `Deployment` for the Pachyderm dashboard.<br> Similar, if `--dashboard-only` is specified, Pachyderm generates <br> the manifests for the Pachyderm enterprise UI only. The most common items <br>that you can edit in `Service` manifests are the `NodePort` values for<br> various services, and the `containerPort` values for `Deployment` manifests.<br> To make your `containerPort` values work properly, add environment <br> variables to a `Deployment` or `StatefulSet` object. You can verify this <br >functionality in the [OpenShift](./openshift.html) example.

**Pachyderm pods manifests**

| Manifest | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Deployment` | Declares the desired state of application pods to Kubernetes. If you <br> configure a static deployment, Pachyderm deploys `Deployment` manifests for <br> `etcd`, `pachd`, and `dash`. If you specify `--dynamic-etcd-nodes`, <br>Pachyderm deploys the `pachd` and `dash` as `Deployment` and `etcd` as a <br> `StatefulSet`. If you run the deploy command with the `--no-dashboard`<br> flag, Pachyderm omits the deployment of the `dash` `Service` and `Deployment`.
| `StatefulSet` | For a `--dynamic-etcd-nodes` deployment, Pachyderm replaces the `etcd` `Deployment` <br> manifest with a `StatefulSet`. |
| `Secret`      | Pachyderm uses the Kubernetes `Secret` manifest to store the credentials that <br> are necessary to access object storage. The final manifest uses the <br> command-line arguments that you submit to the `pachctl deploy` <br> command to store such parameters as region, secret, token, and endpoint, that are <br>used to access an object store. The exact values in the secret <br> depend on the kind of object store you configure for your deployment. You <br>can update the values after the deployment either by using `kubectl` <br>to deploy a new `Secret` or the `pachctl deploy storage` command. |
