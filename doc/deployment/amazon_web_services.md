# Amazon Web Services

We have two methods of deploying pachyderm on AWS, and each is more appropriate for certain circumstances

2. [By manually deploying Kubernetes and Pachyderm.](amazon_web_services.html#manual-pachyderm-deploy)
    - This is more appropriate if you already have a kubernetes deployment, if you would like to customize the types of instances, size of volumes, or you're setting up a production cluster or processing a large workload
1. [By executing a one shot deploy script that will both deploy Kubernetes and Pachyderm.](amazon_web_services.html#one-shot-script)
    - If you're experimenting with Pachyderm, our one-shot script is much faster and simpler.

In addition, we recommend setting up AWS CloudFront for production deployments. AWS puts S3 rate limits in place that can limit the data throughput for your cluster, and CloudFront helps mitigate this issue. Follow these instructions to deploy with CloudFront

## Manual Pachyderm Deploy

### Prerequisites

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) - have it installed and have your [AWS credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) configured.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/)
- [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/install.md)
- [pachctl](#install-pachctl)

### Deploy Kubernetes

The easiest way to install Kubernetes on AWS is with kops. Kubernetes has provided a [step by step guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/aws.md) for the deploy.  Please follow [this guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/aws.md) to deploy Kubernetes on AWS.

Once, you have a Kubernetes cluster up and running in AWS, you should be able to see the following output from `kubectl`:

```shell
$ kubectl get all
NAME             CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
svc/kubernetes   10.0.0.1     <none>        443/TCP   22s
```

### Deploy Pachyderm

To deploy Pachyderm we will need to:

1. Install the `pachctl` CLI tool,
2. Add some storage resources on AWS,
3. Deploy Pachyderm on top of the storage resources.

#### Install `pachctl`

To deploy and interact with Pachyderm, you will need `pachctl`, a command-line utility used for Pachyderm. To install `pachctl` run one of the following:


```shell
# For OSX:
$ brew tap pachyderm/tap && brew install pachyderm/tap/pachctl@1.6

# For Linux (64 bit):
$ curl -o /tmp/pachctl.deb -L https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/releases/download/v1.6.6/pachctl_1.6.6_amd64.deb && sudo dpkg -i /tmp/pachctl.deb
```

You can try running `pachctl version` to check that this worked correctly, but Pachyderm itself isn't deployed yet so you won't get a `pachd` version.

```sh
$ pachctl version
COMPONENT           VERSION
pachctl             1.6.0
pachd               (version unknown) : error connecting to pachd server at address (0.0.0.0:30650): context deadline exceeded.
```

#### Set up the Storage Resources

Pachyderm needs an [S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/), and a [persistent disk](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumes.html) (EBS) to function correctly.

Here are the environmental variables you should set up to create these resources:

```shell
$ kubectl cluster-info
  Kubernetes master is running at https://1.2.3.4
  ...

# BUCKET_NAME needs to be globally unique across the entire AWS region
$ BUCKET_NAME=[The name of the S3 bucket where your data will be stored]

# We recommend between 1 and 10 GB. This stores PFS metadata. For reference 1GB
# should work for 1000 commits on 1000 files.
$ STORAGE_SIZE=[the size of the EBS volume that you are going to create, in GBs. e.g. "10"]

$ AWS_REGION=[the AWS region of your Kubernetes cluster. e.g. "us-west-2" (not us-west-2a)]

$ AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONE=[the AWS availability zone of your Kubernetes cluster. e.g. "us-west-2a"]

```

Then to actually create the resources, you can run:
```
# If AWS_REGION is us-east-1.
$ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket ${BUCKET_NAME} --region ${AWS_REGION}

# If AWS_REGION is outside of us-east-1.
$ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket ${BUCKET_NAME} --region ${AWS_REGION} --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=${AWS_REGION}
```

Now, as a sanity check, you should be able to see the bucket that you just created as follows:

```shell
$ aws s3api list-buckets --query 'Buckets[].Name'
```

#### Deploy Pachyderm

##### Deploying with static credentials

When you installed kops, you should have created a dedicated IAM user (see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/aws.md#aws) for details).  You could deploy Pachyderm using the credentials of the IAM user directly, although that's not recommended:

```sh
$ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[access key ID]

$ AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[secret access key]
```

Run the following command to deploy your Pachyderm cluster:

```shell
$ pachctl deploy amazon ${BUCKET_NAME} ${AWS_REGION} ${STORAGE_SIZE} --dynamic-etcd-nodes=3 --credentials "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID},${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY},"
```

(Note, the `,` at the end of the `credentials` flag in the deploy command is for an optional temporary AWS token, if you are just experimenting with a deploy.  Such a token should NOT be used for a production deploy).  It may take a few minutes for the pachd nodes to be running because it's pulling containers from DockerHub.

##### Deploying with IAM role

Run the following command to deploy your Pachyderm cluster:

```shell
$ pachctl deploy amazon ${BUCKET_NAME} ${AWS_REGION} ${STORAGE_SIZE} --dynamic-etcd-nodes=3 --iam-role <your-iam-role>
```

Note that for this to work, the following need to be true:

* The nodes on which Pachyderm is deployed need to be assigned with the IAM role.  If you created your cluster with kops, the nodes should have a dedicated IAM role.  You should be able to find the IAM role by going to the AWS console, click on a EC2 instance, and look at the "Description" of the instance.

* The IAM role needs to have access to the bucket you just created.  For instance, you could go to the `Permissions` tab of the IAM role, then edit the policy to include the following segment:

```json
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "s3:ListBucket"
        ],
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket"
        ]
},
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:DeleteObject"
    ],
    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/*"
    ]
}
```

Make sure to replace `your-bucket` with your actual bucket name.

* The IAM role needs to have the proper "trust relationships" set up.  Go to the `Trust relationships` tab of your IAM role, click `Edit trust relationship`, and ensure that you see a `statement` with `sts:AssumeRole`.  For instance, this would be a valid trust relationship:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

Once you've run `pachctl deploy`, you can see the cluster status by using:

```sh
$ kubectl get all
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
po/dash-4171841423-rsg4r    2/2       Running   0          1m
po/etcd-0                   1/1       Running   0          1m
po/etcd-1                   1/1       Running   0          1m
po/etcd-2                   1/1       Running   0          56s
po/pachd-2566441599-g2d1q   1/1       Running   2          1m

NAME                CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                     AGE
svc/dash            10.55.252.198   <nodes>       8080:30080/TCP,8081:30081/TCP               1m
svc/etcd            10.55.254.232   <nodes>       2379:30408/TCP                              1m
svc/etcd-headless   None            <none>        2380/TCP                                    1m
svc/kubernetes      10.55.240.1     <none>        443/TCP                                     24m
svc/pachd           10.55.248.19    <nodes>       650:30650/TCP,651:30651/TCP,652:30652/TCP   1m

NAME                DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE
statefulsets/etcd   3         3         1m

NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deploy/dash    1         1         1            1           1m
deploy/pachd   1         1         1            1           1m

NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
rs/dash-4171841423    1         1         1         1m
rs/pachd-2566441599   1         1         1         1m
```

Note: If you see a few restarts on the pachd nodes, that's totally ok. That simply means that Kubernetes tried to bring up those containers before etcd was ready so it restarted them.

Finally, we need to forward a port so that pachctl can talk to the cluster.

```sh
# Forward the ports. We background this process because it blocks.
$ pachctl port-forward &
```

And you're done! You can test to make sure the cluster is working by trying `pachctl version` or even creating a new repo.
```sh
$ pachctl version
COMPONENT           VERSION
pachctl             1.6.0
pachd               1.6.0
```

## One Shot Script

### Prerequisites

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) - have it installed and have your [AWS credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) configured.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/)
- [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/install.md)
- [pachctl](#install-pachctl)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)
- [uuid](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/uuidgen.1.html)

### Run the deploy script

Once you have the prerequisites mentioned above, download and run our AWS deploy script by running:

```
curl -o aws.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/master/etc/deploy/aws.sh
chmod +x aws.sh
sudo -E ./aws.sh
```

This script will use kops to deploy Kubernetes and Pachyderm in AWS.  The script will ask you for your AWS credentials, region preference, etc.  If you would like to customize the number of nodes in the cluster, node types, etc., you can open up the deploy script and modify the respective fields.

The script will take a few minutes, and Pachyderm will take an addition couple of minutes to spin up.  Once it is up, `kubectl get all` should return something like:

```

po/etcd-1                   1/1       Running   0          1m
po/etcd-2                   1/1       Running   0          56s

rs/pachd-2566441599   1         1         1         1m
```

### Connect `pachctl`

Finally, we need to set up forward a port so that pachctl can talk to the cluster.

```sh
# Forward the ports. We background this process because it blocks.
$ pachctl port-forward &
```

And you're done! You can test to make sure the cluster is working by trying `pachctl version`:
```sh
$ pachctl version
COMPONENT           VERSION
pachctl             1.6.0
pachd               1.6.0
```
