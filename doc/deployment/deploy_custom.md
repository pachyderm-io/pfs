# Custom Deployments

This document  details the various options of the `pachctl deploy custom ...` command for an on-premises deployment. 

## Prerequisites

### Software you will need 
    
1. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/)
2. [pachctl](http://docs.pachyderm.io/en/latest/pachctl/pachctl.html)

### Preparing your environment

Please see the [introduction to on-premises deployment](./on_premises.html) for steps you need to take prior to creating a Pachydemerm deployment manifest.

## Creating a Pachyderm manifest

Please see the [introduction to on-premises deployment](./on_premises.html) for an explanation of the differences among static persistent volumes, StatefulSets and StatefulSets with StorageClasses, as well as the meanings of the variables, like  `PVC_STORAGE_SIZE` and `OS_ENDPOINT`, used below.

### Configuring with a static persistent volume
The command you'll want to run is 
```sh
$ pachctl deploy custom --persistent-disk aws --object-store s3 
         ${PVC STORAGE_NAME} ${PVC STORAGE_SIZE} ${OS_BUCKET_NAME} ${OS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} ${OS_SECRET_KEY} ${OS_ENDPOINT} \
         --static-etcd-volume=${PVC_STORAGE_NAME}  \
         --dry-run > pachyderm-with-static-volume.json
```
### Configuring with StatefulSets
The command you'll want to run is 
```sh
$ pachctl deploy custom --object-store s3 any-string 
         ${PVC_STORAGE_SIZE} ${OS_BUCKET_NAME} ${OS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} ${OS_SECRET_KEY} ${OS_ENDPOINT} \
         --dynamic-etcd-nodes=1 \
         --dry-run > pachyderm-with-statefulset.json
```
Note: we use `any-string` as the first argument above because, 
while the `deploy custom` command expects 6 arguments, 
it will ignore the first argument when deploying with StatefulSets.
### Configuring with StatefulSets using StorageClasses
```sh
$ pachctl deploy custom --object-store s3 any-string 
         ${PVC_STORAGE_SIZE} ${OS_BUCKET_NAME} ${OS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} ${OS_SECRET_KEY} ${OS_ENDPOINT} \
         --dynamic-etcd-nodes=1  --etcd-storage-class $PVC_STORAGECLASS \
         --dry-run > pachyderm-with-statefulset-using-storageclasses.json
```
Note: we use `any-string` as the first argument above because, 
while the `deploy custom` command expects 6 arguments, 
it will ignore the first argument when deploying with StatefulSets.

## Next steps

You may either deploy manifests you created above or edit them to customize them further, prior to deploying.

### Editing your manifest to customize it further

This should only be approached if you are an experienced Kubernetes administrator. 

### Deploying
The command you'll want to run depends on the command you ran, above.

#### Deploying with a static persistent volume
```sh
$ kubectl apply -f ./pachyderm-with-static-volume.json
```
#### Deploying  with StatefulSets
```sh
$ kubectl apply -f ./pachyderm-with-statefulset.json
```
#### Deploying  with StatefulSets using StorageClasses
```sh
$ kubectl apply -f ./pachyderm-with-statefulset-using-storageclasses.json
```
