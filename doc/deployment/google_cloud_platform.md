# Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform has excellent support for Kubernetes through the [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/).

### Prerequisites

- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) >= 124.0.0
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/)

If this is the first time you use the SDK, make sure to follow the [quick start guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts). This may update your `~/.bash_profile` and point your `$PATH` at the location where you extracted `google-cloud-sdk`. We recommend extracting this to `~/bin`.

Note, you can also install `kubectl` installed via the SDK using:

```shell
$ gcloud components install kubectl
```

This will download the `kubectl` binary to `google-cloud-sdk/bin`

### Deploy Kubernetes

To create a new Kubernetes cluster in GKE, run:

```sh
$ CLUSTER_NAME=[any unique name, e.g. pach-cluster]

$ GCP_ZONE=[a GCP availability zone. e.g. us-west1-a]

$ gcloud config set compute/zone ${GCP_ZONE}

$ gcloud config set container/cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}

$ MACHINE_TYPE=[machine for the k8s nodes. We recommend "n1-standard-4" or larger.]

# By default this spins up a 3-node cluster. You can change the default with `--num-nodes VAL`
$ gcloud container clusters create ${CLUSTER_NAME} --scopes storage-rw --machine-type ${MACHINE_TYPE}
```
This may take a few minutes to start up. You can check the status on the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances).  Then, after the cluster is up, you can point `kubectl` to this cluster via:

```sh
# Update your kubeconfig to point at your newly created cluster
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER_NAME}
```

As a sanity check, make sure your cluster is up and running via `kubectl`:
```sh
$ kubectl get all
NAME             CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
svc/kubernetes   10.0.0.1     <none>        443/TCP   22s
```

### Deploy Pachyderm

To deploy Pachyderm we will need to:

1. Add some storage resources on Google, 
2. Install the Pachyderm CLI tool, `pachctl`, and
3. Deploy Pachyderm on top of the storage resources.

#### Set up the Storage Resources

Pachyderm needs a [GCS bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/) and a [persistent disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/) to function correctly.  The create the persistent disk:

```shell
# For a demo you should only need 10 GB. This stores PFS metadata. For reference, 1GB
# should work for 1000 commits on 1000 files.
$ STORAGE_SIZE=[the size of the volume that you are going to create, in GBs. e.g. "10"]

# Name this whatever you want, we chose pach-disk as a default
$ STORAGE_NAME=pach-disk

$ gcloud compute disks create --size=${STORAGE_SIZE}GB ${STORAGE_NAME}
```

Then we need to specify the bucket name and create the bucket:
```shell
# BUCKET_NAME needs to be globally unique across the entire GCP region.
$ BUCKET_NAME=[The name of the GCS bucket where your data will be stored]

# Create the bucket.
$ gsutil mb gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
```
To check that everything has been set up correctly, try:

```shell
$ gcloud compute instances list
# should see a number of instances

$ gsutil ls
# should see a bucket

$ gcloud compute disks list
# should see a number of disks, including the one you specified
```

#### Install `pachctl`

`pachctl` is a command-line utility for interacting with a Pachyderm cluster.


```shell
# For OSX:
$ brew tap pachyderm/tap && brew install pachyderm/tap/pachctl@1.4

# For Linux (64 bit):
$ curl -o /tmp/pachctl.deb -L https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/releases/download/v1.4.3/pachctl_1.4.3_amd64.deb && sudo dpkg -i /tmp/pachctl.deb
```

You can try running `pachctl version` to check that this worked correctly, but Pachyderm itself isn't deployed yet so you won't get a `pachd` version.

```sh
$ pachctl version
COMPONENT           VERSION             
pachctl             1.4.0           
pachd               (version unknown) : error connecting to pachd server at address (0.0.0.0:30650): context deadline exceeded

please make sure pachd is up (`kubectl get all`) and portforwarding is enabled
```

#### Deploy Pachyderm

Now we're ready to deploy Pachyderm itself.  This can be done in one command:

```sh
pachctl deploy google ${BUCKET_NAME} ${STORAGE_SIZE} --static-etcd-volume=${STORAGE_NAME}
```

It may take a few minutes for the pachd nodes to be running because it's pulling containers from DockerHub. You can see the cluster status by using:

```sh
$ kubectl get all
NAME             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
po/etcd-wn317    1/1       Running   0          5m
po/pachd-mljp6   1/1       Running   3          5m

NAME       DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
rc/etcd    1         1         1         5m
rc/pachd   1         1         1         5m

NAME             CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                         AGE
svc/etcd         10.0.0.165   <nodes>       2379:32379/TCP,2380:32686/TCP   5m
svc/kubernetes   10.0.0.1     <none>        443/TCP                         5m
svc/pachd        10.0.0.214   <nodes>       650:30650/TCP,651:30651/TCP     5m
```

Note: If you see a few restarts on the pachd nodes, that's totally ok. That simply means that Kubernetes tried to bring up those containers before other components were ready so it restarted them.

Finally, assuming your `pachd` is running as shown above, we need to set up forward a port so that `pachctl` can talk to the cluster.

```sh
# Forward the ports. We background this process because it blocks.
$ pachctl port-forward &
```

And you're done! You can test to make sure the cluster is working by trying `pachctl version` or even creating a new repo.

```sh
$ pachctl version
COMPONENT           VERSION
pachctl             1.4.0
pachd               1.4.0
```
