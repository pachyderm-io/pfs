# Incremental Processing

Pachyderm performs computations in an incremental fashion.  That is, rather
than computing a result all at once, it computes it in small pieces and
then stitches those pieces together to form results. This allows Pachyderm to reuse results and compute
things much more efficiently than traditional systems, which are forced to compute everything from
scratch during every job.  

If you are new to the idea of Pachyderm "datums," you can learn more [here](http://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fundamentals/distributed_computing.html#datums).  

## Inter-datum Incrementality

Each of the input datums in a Pachyderm pipeline is processed in isolation, and the results of these isolated
computations are combined to create the final result. Pachyderm will never
process the same datum twice (unless you update a pipeline with the
`--reprocess` flag). If you commit new data in Pachyderm that leaves some of the previously existing datums
intact, the results of processing those pre-existing datums in a previous job will
also remain intact.  That is, the previous results for those pre-existing datums won't
be recalculated.

This inter-datum incrementality is best illustrated with
an example. Suppose we have a pipeline with a single input that looks like this:

```json
{
  "pfs": {
    "repo": "R",
    "glob": "/*",
  }
}
```

Now, suppose you make a commit to `R` which adds a single file `F1`. Your
pipeline will run a job, and that job will find a single datum to process (`F1`).
This datum will be processed, because it's the first time the pipeline has
seen `F1`.

If you then make a second commit to `R` adding another file `F2`, 
the pipeline will run a second job. This job will find two datums to
process (`F1` and `F2`). `F2` will be processed, because it hasn't been seen before. However `F1` will NOT be
processed, because an output from processing it already exists in Pachyderm. 

Instead, the output from the previous job for `F1` will be combined with the
new result from processing `F2` to create the
output of this second job. This reuse of the result for `F1` effectively halves the amount of work necessary
to process the second commit.

Finally, suppose you make a third commit to `R`, which modifies `F1`. Again
you'll have a job that sees two datums (the new `F1` and the already processed `F2`). This time
`F2` won't get processed, but the new `F1` will be processed because it has different
content as compared to the old `F1`.

Note, you as a user don't need to do anything to enable this
inter-datum incrementality. It happens automatically, and it should should be transparent from
your perspective. In the above example, you get the
same result you would have gotten if you committed the same data in a single
commit. 

As of Pachyderm v1.5.1, `list job` and `inspect job` will tell you how many
datums the job processed and how many it skipped. Below is an example of
a job that had 5 datums, 3 that were processed and 2 that were skipped.

```
ID                                   OUTPUT COMMIT                             STARTED            DURATION           RESTART PROGRESS      DL       UL       STATE

```
