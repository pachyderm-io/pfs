# Combine, Merge, and Join Data

Before you read this section, make sure that you understand the concepts
described in [Distributed Processing](distributed_computing.html)

In some of your projects, you might need to match datums from
multiple data repositories to process, join, or aggregate data. For
example, you might need to process together multiple records that
correspond to a certain user, experiment, or device.

In these cases, you can create to pipelines that perform the following
steps:

![Steps](../images/d_steps_combine_pipelines.svg)

More specifically, you need to create the following pipelines:

1. Create a pipeline that groups all of the records for a specific
key and index.

2. Create another pipeline that takes that grouped output and performs
the merging, joining, or other processing for the group.

You can use these two data-combining pipelines for
merging or grouped processing of data from various experiments,
devices, and so on. You can also apply the same pattern to
perform distributed joins of tabular data or data from database
tables. For example, you can join user email records together
with user IP records on the key and index of a user ID.

You can parallelize each of the stages across workers to
scale with the size of your data and the number of data
sources that you want to merge.

**Tip:** If your data is not split into separate files for
each record, you can split it automatically as described in
[Splitting Data for Distributed Processing](splitting.html).

## Group Matching Records

The first pipeline that you create groups the records that
need to be processed together.

In this example, you have two repositories `A` and `B`
with JSON records.
These repositories might correspond to two experiments, two geographic
regions, two different devices that generate data, or other.

The following diagram displays the first pipeline:

The repository `A` has the following structure:

```bash
$ pachctl list file A@master
NAME                TYPE                SIZE
1.json              file                39 B
2.json              file                39 B
3.json              file                39 B
```

The repository `B` has the following structure:

```bash
$ pachctl list file B@master
NAME                TYPE                SIZE
1.json              file                39 B
2.json              file                39 B
3.json              file                39 B
```

If you want to process `A/1.json` with `B/1.json` to merge
their contents or otherwise process them together, you need to
group each set of JSON records into respective datums that
the pipelines that you create in
[Process grouped records](#process-grouped-records)
can process together.

The grouping pipeline takes a union of `A` and `B` as inputs,
each with glob pattern `/*`. While the pipeline processes a JSON file,
the data is copied to a folder in the output that corresponds to the
key and index for that record. In this example, it is just the
number in the file name. Pachyderm also renames the files to
unique names that correspond to the source:

```
/1
  A.json
  B.json
/2
  A.json
  B.json
/3
  A.json
  B.json
```

When you group your data, set the following parameters in the pipeline
specification:

- In the `pfs` section, set `"empty_files": true` to avoid
unnecessary downloads of data.

- Use symlinks to avoid unnecessary uploads of data and unnecessary data
duplication.

## Process Grouped Records

After you group the records together by using the grouping pipeline, you
can use a merging pipeline on the `group` repository with a glob
pattern of `/*`. By using the glob pattern of `/*`
the pipeline can process each grouping of records in parallel.

THe following diagram displays the second pipeline:

The second pipeline performs merging, aggregation, or other
processing on the respective grouping of records. It can also
output each respective result to the root of the output directory:

```
$ pachctl list file merge@master
NAME                TYPE          SIZE
result_1.json       file          39 B
result_2.json       file          39 B
result_3.json       file          39 B
```
