Pachyderm is an enterprise-grade, open source data science platform that
makes explainable, repeatable, and scalable Machine Learning (ML) and
Artificial Intelligence (AI) a reality. The Pachyderm platform brings
together version control for data with the tools to build scalable
end-to-end ML/AI pipelines while empowering users to develop their
code in a language, framework, or tool of their choice. Pachyderm
has been proven to be the ideal foundation for teams looking to
use ML/AI to solve real-world problems in a reliable way. What
makes Pachyderm such a natural choice for data science teams is
that with just one click, a user can know exactly what data was used
to train a model.

The Pachyderm platform includes the following main components:

- Pachyderm File System (PFS)
- Pachyderm pipelines

To start, you need to understand the foundational concepts of Pachyderm's
data versioning and pipeline semantics. After you have a good grasp of
the basics, you can use advanced concepts and features for more
complicated challenges.

This section describes main Pachyderm concepts including the following
