# Spouts

## Introduction

Spouts are a way to get streaming data from any source into Pachyderm.
To create a spout, you need three things

1. A source of streaming data: a message queue (Kafka, nifi, rabbitMQ, etc.), a database's change feed, the stream of [Event Notifications on an S3 bucket (via Amazon SQS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html), etc.
1. A Docker container holding your spout code that reads from the data source.
1. A spout pipeline specification file that uses the container.

Your spout code will do four things:

1. connect to your source of streaming data
1. read the data
1. package it into files in a `tar` stream
1. write that `tar` stream to the named pipe `/pfs/out`


In this document, 
we'll take you through writing the spout code (with example code in Golang) and writing the spout pipeline specification.

## Creating your containerized spout code

To create the spout process,
you'll need access to client libraries
for your streaming data source,
a library that can write the `tar` archive format
(such as [Go's tar package](https://golang.org/pkg/archive/tar/) 
or [Python's tarfile module](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/tarfile.html)),
and requirements for how you would like to batch your data.
For the purposes of this document, 
we'll assume each message in the stream
is a single file.

You need that `tar` library because,
in spouts,
`/pfs/out` is a named pipe. 
This is different than in pipelines, 
where `/pfs/out` is a directory.

In the example below, 
written in Go
and taken from the [kafka example](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/master/examples/kafka)
in the Pachyderm repo, 
we'll go through every step you need to take.

If you have trouble following this Go code,
just read the text to get an idea of what you need to do.

### Import necessary libraries

We'll import the libraries necessary for creating a `tar` archive data stream
and connecting to our Kafka data source.

```go
package main

import (
	"archive/tar"
	"context"
	"os"
	"strings"
	"time"

	kafka "github.com/segmentio/kafka-go"
)

```
### Parameterizing connection information
It's a good idea to get parameters
for connecting to your data source 
from the environment
or command-line parameters. 
That way you can connect to new data sources
using the same container code
without recompiling
by just setting appropriate parameters
in the pipeline specification.
```Go
func main() {
	// Get the connection info from the ENV vars
	host := os.Getenv("HOST")
	port := os.Getenv("PORT")
	topic := os.Getenv("TOPIC")
```

### Connect to the streaming data source

We're creating an object
that can be used to read from our data source.

That `defer` statement is the Go way to guarantee
that the open file will be closed
after the code in `main()` runs, 
but before it returns.
That is, 
`reader.Close()` won't be executed
until after `main()` is finished with everything else.
(This is a common idiom in Go;
to `defer` the close of a resource
right after you open it.)
```Go
	// And create a new kafka reader
	reader := kafka.NewReader(kafka.ReaderConfig{
		Brokers:  []string{host + ":" + port},
		Topic:    topic,
		MinBytes: 10e1,
		MaxBytes: 10e6,
	})
	defer reader.Close()
```

### Open /pfs/out for writing

We're opening the named pipe `/pfs/out` for writing,
so we can send it a `tar` archive stream with the files we want to output.
Note that the named pipe has to be opened with write-only permissions.
```Go
	// Open the /pfs/out pipe with write only permissons (the pachyderm spout will be reading at the other end of this)
	// Note: it won't work if you try to open this with read, or read/write permissions
	out, err := os.OpenFile("/pfs/out", os.O_WRONLY, 0644)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer out.Close()
```

### Write the outer file loop
Here we open a tar stream into the directory we opened above,
so that Pachyderm can place files into the output repo.
For clarity's sake,
we'll omit the message-processing loop inside this file loop.
The `err` variable is used in the message-processing loop for errors reading from the stream and writing to the directory.
The stream is opened at the top of the loop and should be closed at the bottom.
In this case, 
it'll be closed after a message is processed.
The commit is finished after the file stream closes.
(The `defer tw.Close()` is wrapped in an anonymous function to control when it gets run; 
it'll run right before the anonymous function is finished.)
Think of the `tw.Close()` as a `FinishCommit()`.

```Go
	// this is the file loop
	for {
		if err := func() error {
			tw := tar.NewWriter(out)
			defer tw.Close()
			// this is the message loop
			for {

				// ...omitted

			}
		}(); err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
	}
```

### Create the message processing loop

Once again, if you have trouble following this Go code,
just read the text to get an idea of what you need to do.

First,
we read a message from our Kafka queue.
Note the use of a 5-second timeout on the read.
That's so if the data source,
Kafka,
hangs for some reason, 
the spout itself doesn't hang,
but gives a hopefully useful error message in the logs after crashing.

```Go
			// this is the message loop
			for {
				// read a message
				ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
				defer cancel()
				m, err := reader.ReadMessage(ctx)
				if err != nil {
					return err
				}
```

Then we write a filename and the size of the file in a file header to the `tar` stream we opened at the beginning of the file loop.
This tar stream will be used by Pachyderm to create files in the output repo.
```Go
				// give it a unique name
				name := topic + time.Now().Format(time.RFC3339Nano)
				// write the header
				for err = tw.WriteHeader(&tar.Header{
					Name: name,
					Mode: 0600,
					Size: int64(len(m.Value)),
				}); err != nil; {
					if !strings.Contains(err.Error(), "broken pipe") {
						return err
					}
					// if there's a broken pipe, just give it some time to get ready for the next message
					time.Sleep(5 * time.Millisecond)
				}
```

Then we write the actual message as the contents of the file.
Note the use of a timeout in case the named pipe is broken.
The reason for this is that the other end of the spout
(Pachyderm's code)
has closed the named pipe at the end of the previous read. 
If it gets an error writing to the named pipe,
our code should back off,
because Pachyderm may not have reopened the named pipe yet.

If you're batching the messages with longer time intervals between writes,
this may not be necessary,
but it is a good practice to establish for ruggedizing your code.
Note: 
If a more serious error occurs on the named pipe,
it may be that a crash has occurred that will be visible in the logs for the pipeline.
Any of these errors will be visible in the pipeline's user logs,
accessible with `pachctl logs --pipeline=<your pipeline name>`.
```Go
				// and the message
				for _, err = tw.Write(m.Value); err != nil; {
					if !strings.Contains(err.Error(), "broken pipe") {
						return err
					}
					// if there's a broken pipe, just give it some time to get ready for the next message
					time.Sleep(5 * time.Millisecond)
				}
				return nil
			}
```

That's the rough outline of operations for processing data in queues and writing it to Pachyderm via a spout.

### Create the container for the code

To start, you'll need to [create a Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)
In our example above,
we created a server using Go.
The Dockerfile for creating a container
with that server in it is in the [kafka example](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/master/examples/kafka).

With your Dockerfile written, you can build your container by running `docker build -t myaccount/myimage:0.1 .` and push it to Docker Hub (or any other registry) with `docker push myaccount/myimage:0.1`.

Once you have containerized your code,
you can place it in a Pachyderm spout by writing an appropriate pipeline specification.

## Writing the spout pipeline specification

A spout is defined using [a pipeline spec](../reference/pipeline_spec.html) with a `spout` field, 
and created using the `pachctl create pipeline` command.

Continuing with our example Docker container from above,
we might define the specification for the spout as something like this:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "name": "my-spout"
  },
  "transform": {
    "cmd": [ "go", "run", "./main.go" ],
    "image": "myaccount/myimage:0.1"
  },
  "env": {
    "HOST": "kafkahost",
    "TOPIC": "mytopic",
    "PORT": "9092"
  },
  "spout": {
    "overwrite": false
  }
}
```

Note that the `overwrite` property on the spout is `false` by default;
setting it to `true` would be like having the `--overwrite` flag specified on every `pachctl put file`.

With the spec written, we would then use `pachctl create pipeline -f my-spout.json` to install the spout.
It would begin processing messages
and placing them in the `my-spout` repo.

## Combine a Spout with a Service

You can create a pipeline that can act as both a spout and a service.
If you want your spout pipeline to combine these two functionalities, add
the following to the spout pipeline specification:

```bash

"spout": {
    "overwrite": false,
    "service": {
        "internal_port": 8200,
        "external_port": 31467,
        "annotations": {
            "foo": "bar"
        }
    }
}
 ```

This specification creates an endpoint that can read and serve
data from Pachyderm and write data back into a Pachyderm repository.
