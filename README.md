# Pachyderm: Data Pipelines

Pachyderm is a tool for production data pipelines. If you need to chain
together data scraping, ingestion, cleaning, munging, wrangling, processing,
modeling, and analysis in a sane way, then Pachyderm is for you. If you have an
existing set of scripts which do this in an ad-hoc fashion and you're looking
for a way to "productionize" them, Pachyderm can make this easy for you.

## Features

- Containerized: Pachyderm is built on Docker and Kubernetes. Whatever
  languages or libraries your pipeline needs, they can run on Pachyderm which
  can easily be deployed on any cloud provider or on prem.
- Version Control: Pachyderm version controls your data as it's processed. You
  can always ask the system how data has changed, see a diff, and, if something
  doesn't look right, revert.
- Provenance (aka data lineage): Pachyderm tracks where data comes from. Pachyderm keeps track of all the code and  data that created a result.
- Parallelization: Pachyderm can efficiently schedule massively parallel
  workloads.
- Incremental Processing: Pachyderm understands how your data has changed and
  is smart enough to only process the new data.
